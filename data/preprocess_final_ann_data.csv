Using  as a perfect example created by cnnr_cllhn 
cnnr_cllhn LoseTheVery is a fantastic tool that finds a more concise adjective without using very Example very rich  affluent
The core idea is simple and the UI was chosen to reflect that Its straight to the point just like the Google Search homepage So whats the problem 
cnnr_cllhn  There are 3 main flaws
1 Site feels messy
2 Design lacks consistency
3 Elements feel a little too cramped
Well approach it via negativa style by removing stuff rather than adding
 Lets work on that that using figma
cnnr_cllhn figma 1 Decluttering 
The most important step would be to remove the clutter  the annoying newsletter popup the newsletter section and the newsletter banner Well get back to it later
This has already made a difference The interface looks significantly cleaner 
cnnr_cllhn figma 2 Let the design breathe 
Lets add more whitespace  the more the better This will achieve a better visual separation
Now the very  x  y line instantly grabs our attention 
cnnr_cllhn figma 3 Making buttons prettier 
Buttons look chaotic here randomly spaced different padding etc
Lets increase the font size adjust the padding and replace the word random with a dice icon Well also invert the third button

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view

4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped

When I disable the Chrome Hardware acceleration I am able to open the Figma without any issue albeit slower

Is there anyway to fix it
I need to enable the hardware acceleration for other chrome features But then I wont be able to use Figma if I do so
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files
If this is happening on a specific file then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits
Figma is a browserbased app which means its subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab including those in our Desktop App When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes
I recommend you to
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages for example by splitting a page into multiple pages will usually help with rendering performance
Hidden layers loading and then hiding a large number of layers especially in components or with images stored in them can cause a high use of available memory on loading
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here Hope it helps
Hi Celine_Doan
Its happening to all files actually
Which is weird since i can still access all files without issue if i turned the browser hardware acceleration off
i also tried using my other laptop with the hardware acceleration on to open all the files and it does not have the same issue
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Thank you for the details
Can you also ensure WebGL is enabled in Google Chrome The steps to do this are in this article 
If it is still doesnt fix your issue please reach out to the team by filling this form with all detail you recall WEBGL issue happening to all files affecting browser andor desktop etc here
Our technical team can investigate further Thank you

Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a Special offer label placed inside the picture
In order to reproduce the issue
Step 1 Create a text field turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color just to create a label basically like FLASH SALE etc
Step 2 Add a rectangle and fill it with an image
Step 3 Turn both into an AutoLayout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside While doing so you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it even when the label layer is above the image
Despite that when merging a text and an image into AutoLayout and only then turning the text to AutoLayout as well to give if a fill color  this method works perfectly fine but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned so there might be a bug here Or is it

When I disable the Chrome Hardware acceleration I am able to open the Figma without any issue albeit slower

Is there anyway to fix it
I need to enable the hardware acceleration for other chrome features But then I wont be able to use Figma if I do so
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files
If this is happening on a specific file then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits
Figma is a browserbased app which means its subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab including those in our Desktop App When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes
I recommend you to
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages for example by splitting a page into multiple pages will usually help with rendering performance
Hidden layers loading and then hiding a large number of layers especially in components or with images stored in them can cause a high use of available memory on loading
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here Hope it helps
Hi Celine_Doan
Its happening to all files actually
Which is weird since i can still access all files without issue if i turned the browser hardware acceleration off
i also tried using my other laptop with the hardware acceleration on to open all the files and it does not have the same issue
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Thank you for the details
Can you also ensure WebGL is enabled in Google Chrome The steps to do this are in this article 
If it is still doesnt fix your issue please reach out to the team by filling this form with all detail you recall WEBGL issue happening to all files affecting browser andor desktop etc here

727,figma,Twitter,"Ive been a designer for a little over 13 years Early in my design career I started feeling like I wanted a more technical role and switched to frontend development
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for me
At the time I was building custom WordPress themes 
Within my theme Id have a partials folder full of my silly little components
And I had my templates folder full of my silly little templates
Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular maintainable and organised template files
Seeing it all come together was a huge aha moment for me but I didnt know why Â at the time design systems wasnt a wellknown concept
I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass extending classes using mixins and all that fun CSS goodness

Looking back at it now I realise that what I was really kind of doing was implementing a simplified version of component properties
Code felt natural and intuitive  I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly But design tooling wasnt anywhere close to what it is now
Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying pasting and replacing The process felt outdated and ineffective and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code even the tiniest bit
When I learned about Figma a few years later it felt like a huge weight had been lifted and my passion for design exploded
Im so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly and some of the gaps between designdev are starting to thin out
This was a lot of tweets about nothing but I woke up feeling so in love with my career 
And just generally grateful that I get to sit around all day working on design systems architecting components crafting design patterns and collaborating with developers 
I dont think Id be so passionate about my career if figma didnt come around when it did  Its setting the standard of things to come and were only at the beginning","The user has published a new version of the #pagger in the @figma community, which now allows users to assign tags, prevents the state of the pages from being shared between accounts, and allows users to test it as long as they want (not in the same file).",0.0992277041077613,train

Step 1
Create a new artboard and add a rectangle with a grey fill 
Step 2
Go into vector edit mode and select 2 anchor points Manipulate those till you get an angle you like 
Step 3
Repeat the first 2 steps and make sure to connect each begin of a fold with the end points of the previous one 
Step 4 
Step 5
Time for some color Create a linear gradient going from light to dark and copy amp paste the style to your vectors OPTCMDC gt OPTCMDV
Tip Use more than 2 color stops in your gradient for a unique look 
Step 6
Nice Now we just have to change the gradient angles for every other vector to create more realistic lighting 
Step 7
To take your gradient fold to the next level introduce some extra color combinations 
Bonus Step
You can try to go for a top and bottom gradient effect as shown below 
Okay one more bonus step
You can even try to split up a larger gradient in multiple stops to create an effect like shown below

thank you
Raffaele_Parlato hey I also faced the same problem and hours of researching I found the issue Instead of applying dropshadow on every card individually but instead group the cards together and then applying it as a whole This should completely fix the problem
Raffaele_Parlato Im not exactly sure what the issue is here with the scrolling Im just guessing the system adds the shadow to the size of the cards but I also found another problem with this which is the shadows actually overlap on one another although it may not seem so I used the colorpicker to test but when you group them together the shadows are always at the bottom and do not go over other cards"," Pasting to replace an existing component from Figma to FigJam causes the object to shift its position, which is especially annoying when creating flow diagrams.

1008,figma,Twitter,"Ive been a designer for a little over 13 years Early in my design career I started feeling like I wanted a more technical role and switched to frontend development
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for me
At the time I was building custom WordPress themes 
Within my theme Id have a partials folder full of my silly little components
And I had my templates folder full of my silly little templates
Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular maintainable and organised template files
Seeing it all come together was a huge aha moment for me but I didnt know why Â at the time design systems wasnt a wellknown concept
I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass extending classes using mixins and all that fun CSS goodness

Looking back at it now I realise that what I was really kind of doing was implementing a simplified version of component properties
Code felt natural and intuitive  I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly But design tooling wasnt anywhere close to what it is now
Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying pasting and replacing The process felt outdated and ineffective and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code even the tiniest bit
When I learned about Figma a few years later it felt like a huge weight had been lifted and my passion for design exploded
Im so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly and some of the gaps between designdev are starting to thin out
This was a lot of tweets about nothing but I woke up feeling so in love with my career 
And just generally grateful that I get to sit around all day working on design systems architecting components crafting design patterns and collaborating with developers 
I dont think Id be so passionate about my career if figma didnt come around when it did  Its setting the standard of things to come and were only at the beginning","The user has published a new version of the #pagger in the @figma community, which now allows users to assign tags, prevents the state of the pages from being shared between accounts, and allows users to test it as long as they want (not in the same file).",0.0992277041077613,train

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a Special offer label placed inside the picture
In order to reproduce the issue
Step 1 Create a text field turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color just to create a label basically like FLASH SALE etc
Step 2 Add a rectangle and fill it with an image
Step 3 Turn both into an AutoLayout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside While doing so you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it even when the label layer is above the image
Despite that when merging a text and an image into AutoLayout and only then turning the text to AutoLayout as well to give if a fill color  this method works perfectly fine but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned so there might be a bug here Or is it

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space

1253,Notion,Twitter,"Arc browser continuous review
Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space
Eg my Slack always open links in my work spaceprofile
Im logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces
JiriJerabek browsercompany Great question Not right now but this feature for link routing by Space is coming in a couple weeks 
Cant wait to hear what you think","
 The user is enjoying the new features in Arc, including the split view, sidebar, and the ability to pin folders.

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd

5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space
Eg my Slack always open links in my work spaceprofile
Im logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces
JiriJerabek browsercompany Great question Not right now but this feature for link routing by Space is coming in a couple weeks

7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone

8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a Special offer label placed inside the picture
In order to reproduce the issue
Step 1 Create a text field turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color just to create a label basically like FLASH SALE etc
Step 2 Add a rectangle and fill it with an image
Step 3 Turn both into an AutoLayout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside While doing so you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it even when the label layer is above the image
Despite that when merging a text and an image into AutoLayout and only then turning the text to AutoLayout as well to give if a fill color  this method works perfectly fine but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned so there might be a bug here Or is it

FigJams simplicity and ease of use enables fast mapping and sharing of complex systems and dependencies Ive recently created several sprawling figjam charts that outline marketing programs from beginning to end for our clients They have been so helpful keeping the team informed at a high level and are a great reference to regularly huddle around 
 
This is just one kind of use  because of its flexibility you can begin to discover ways to think and present ideas large or small Create fast design mockups review and provide feedback on designs create storyboards  the list can go on and on Easily shareable to anyone with little to no trouble with login attempts or dealing with incompatible file types

What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space
Eg my Slack always open links in my work spaceprofile
Im logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a Special offer label placed inside the picture
In order to reproduce the issue
Step 1 Create a text field turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color just to create a label basically like FLASH SALE etc
Step 2 Add a rectangle and fill it with an image
Step 3 Turn both into an AutoLayout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside While doing so you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it even when the label layer is above the image
Despite that when merging a text and an image into AutoLayout and only then turning the text to AutoLayout as well to give if a fill color  this method works perfectly fine but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned so there might be a bug here Or is it

So I guess whats happening is that the prototype gets stuck between a situation where its opening an overlay because the mouse is on Shop and also closing the overlay because if the mouse has left Shop then it should close This is why it seems to flicker To fix this Id recommend using interactive components instead of the Overlay feature An example of what Im talking about is in the community file

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a Special offer label placed inside the picture
In order to reproduce the issue
Step 1 Create a text field turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color just to create a label basically like FLASH SALE etc
Step 2 Add a rectangle and fill it with an image
Step 3 Turn both into an AutoLayout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside While doing so you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it even when the label layer is above the image
Despite that when merging a text and an image into AutoLayout and only then turning the text to AutoLayout as well to give if a fill color  this method works perfectly fine but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned so there might be a bug here Or is it

Me They ALL run INSIDE my obsdmd  
Be a rebel  
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called Electron
Electron is just a Chrome browser that runs like an app on your desktop
So essentially Obsidian  Snazzy Browser for your notes
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd This allows us  in theory  to browse any website
In practice it works 80 of the time hence I couldnt get it to work with tana_inc or logseq 
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box  with a plugin its easy Lets get to it
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Go to Settings gt Community Plugins Search for Custom Frames
Install it 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry Custom Frames towards end of your list
Find the New Frame button and click it A Frame is such a browser window that we can use to access all of the services
The new entry will appear in the list above the button 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL   or   copy amp paste from Browser
2  open in center to open the service like a tab otherwise its in the sidebar
3  Add Ribbon Icon to display a side icon 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Specify the icon you want to use
Go to  and find an icon you like
Copy paste its name into the icon textfield in previous step 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left
You will have to log in to GoogleAppleEvernote the first time But then it will remember you Just like in a browser
On the top right you find a few buttons to reload the page

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped

1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users

Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos

This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor

I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good

Miro is easier to use than an actual whiteboard In particular its easy to attach write move and connect sticky notes and it automatically corrects the connection lines so you can use it more efficiently than an actual whiteboard So you can focus on the discussion Also miro is great for sharing information you create online ensuring that the same image information is conveyed As a comparison to other similar tools its nice to have reaction features icons and formatting that you cant use up

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped

Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay

What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space

One thing that I have found to be a drawback of Miro is its pricing structure While the platform offers a free plan its more advanced features are only available with paid plans which may be expensive for smaller teams or individuals Additionally the platforms extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users and it may take some time to learn how to use everything effectively However Miros support resources including video tutorials and a user community are quite helpful in getting up to speed quickly",The user loves FigJam for its ease of use and prefers it over multiple apps for conceptualizing ideas and storyboards.

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space
Eg my Slack always open links in my work spaceprofile
Im logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces

Our issue is that we have team members working on each version 1 and 2 but we cant create a new feature branch for the version 2 branch we dont have this issue for version 1 because that is the main branch
Our question is if does exist an official way to work with different versions in the same file in order to handle versioning or if there is a better way to do this
Example of what we need
Button v1 branch main
a new feature for Button v1 a new branch from the main branch
Button v2 branch version 2 branch
a new feature for Button v2 a new branch from version 2 branch
The second question is how to handle major minor and patch updates into Figma following semantic versioning definition

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay

The DLS and the the first App will be created as two separate design files within the same project My hope was that at various intervals I would be able to copy and paste content from the App into the DLS then publish the library from the DLS and get the other team to use the library swap feature to swap their local components with those from the DLS published library
But my initial tests lead me to believe that this isnt possible It seems that you can only use library swap on two externally published libraries rather than an external library the DLS and a local library the App Is this the case
If so what is the suggested workflow in this situation
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated Many thanks

To take your gradient fold to the next level introduce some extra color combinations 
Bonus Step 
You can try to go for a top and bottom gradient effect as shown below 
Okay one more bonus step 
You can even try to split up a larger gradient in multiple stops to create an effect like shown below
