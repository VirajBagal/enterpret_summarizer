Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: This review is more about Notion itself than the app. After reviewing a bunch of other programs I subscribed to Notion to help build my new businesses internal infrastructure. I was happy at first but it seems that the moment anything goes wrong Notion support is less than helpful. I‚Äôve been going back and forth with Notion support trying to fix some billing issues (updating my payment details). Notion seems fairly incapable of actually troubleshooting the problem and at this point as I keep getting the same suggestions from different ‚Äòpeople‚Äô I‚Äôm convinced Notion help is running on AI and not an actual human with problem solving skills. Despite numerous occasions saying the system won‚Äôt let me update my payment details and suggesting an actual bug that may be causing the issues their reply was: It‚Äôs so easy, you don‚Äôt even have to log in. Please update your information with this link. Also to note, you only get a reply every 24 hours, so after every (it‚Äôs so simple update your info) communication gets a bit tiresome. If you‚Äôve seen Sh*+s creek this whole exchange was the equivalent of ‚Äújust fold in the cheese - what do you mean - it‚Äôs easy, you just fold in the cheese‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried to escalate this to a dept manager or someone in tech that would hopefully have the skills beyond ‚Äúit‚Äôs so easy just update your information‚Äù however the more frustrated I get the less inclined they seem to be to help me. It‚Äôs at the point where I‚Äôm considering switching to another service which will be a hard decision seeing as we have put a lot of time into building our systems in Notion. Also to note despite being told that the old payment info is incorrect and I cannot update my payment details they continue to attempt to bill the old card number and then send me warnings that I need to update my information. So, let this be a cautionary tale for anyone using Notion for their business - it‚Äôs good, until it‚Äôs not. At which point you better be able to problem solve on your own. Just fold in the cheese.","User is frustrated with Notion support, as they are unable to update their payment details and are being billed for the old card number.

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: I‚Äôve been looking for an app with the kind of capabilities notion has for sometime, but was hesitant to download because of all the reviews relating to its poor performance on the iPad (which is where I do most of my work), but eventually decided to give it a go since most of the reviews I saw were at least a year old and I figured they might have sorted out the bugs in it by now.
They have not. I‚Äôm writing this, not 20 minutes after initially downloading and testing it out and it‚Äôs already very clear to me that it simply doesn‚Äôt work. This is only a matter of the interface (which I would say is not super intuitive anyway) - I could have overlooked that, assuming I would get used to it with time - the very basics were not functional. It‚Äôs a battle to do even the simplest actions; scrolling down the page, selecting a template, deleting and creating pages - all the things you rely on regardless of whether the interface is to your liking. Was very willing to give this a good try before I disregarded it, but I don‚Äôt even see how that would be possible without risking all of my uni work/notes. Definitely needs a rethink, which is a shame because, according to the reviews, it works so well on laptop/PC and is obviously very effective. But this app is not conducive to working on an iPad, which effectively renders the point of having a tool that‚Äôs supposed to keep everything in one, easily accessible place moot, because, if you use a tablet (even if it‚Äôs not your main device) you simply can‚Äôt use it on there and so would either not be able to use your iPad anytime you wanted to make a note, or would have to have two separate systems. Would 100% give it another go if this problem is fixed, but at the moment, it‚Äôs just not working.","User is disappointed with the app's performance on the iPad, as it is not intuitive and does not work as expected.

There are a few flaws though: there is no offline mode, the AI features that I don‚Äòt use cannot be deactivated, is is not as fast as a native app like apple notes/simplenote/etc., there is no real pen-support for drawing and sketching, the app logs me out frequently and that feeling of ‚Äûhaving too many eggs in one basket‚Äú
One improvement that would be great: on iOS when I share a youtube video to a notion database via share sheet, the URL is the title. It would be great if the title was the video title and the URL was an embedded video in the content. Adding Tags when sharing would also be helpful.","User enjoys using Notion for note-taking and syncing between devices, but has issues with the lack of offline mode, AI features not being deactivated, and the app logging them out frequently.

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: This app worked fine as a free user, however after becoming a subscribed member, I ran into some annoying and suspicious issues. I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes. Of course, there‚Äôs a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer. I paid $4.99 for the one month subscription, but it won‚Äôt actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe, but I already have. The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay. My app says I am a subscribed member, so why is it denying me member benefits? I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone, restarting the app, deleting and downloading the app again, logging out and then back in etc. Nothing has worked so far. Not only do I feel robbed, but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription, I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses, but after subscribing, it sends me straight to the subscription choice page. That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it, regardless of if that is actually the case or not. Looking through some of the other lower reviews, I am not the only one who has ran into this problem. Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for.

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: This app worked fine as a free user, however after becoming a subscribed member, I ran into some annoying and suspicious issues. I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes. Of course, there‚Äôs a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer. I paid $4.99 for the one month subscription, but it won‚Äôt actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe, but I already have. The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay.
My app says I am a subscribed member, so why is it denying me member benefits? I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone, restarting the app, deleting and downloading the app again, logging out and then back in etc. Nothing has worked so far. Not only do I feel robbed, but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription, I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses, but after subscribing, it sends me straight to the subscription choice page. That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it, regardless of if that is actually the case or not. Looking through some of the other lower reviews, I am not the only one who has ran into this problem. Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for.

As a single person, notion is completely free with next to no restrictions. Teams will require payment, but it has a free trial to see how you like it, and I consider it fantastic for groups. However, that being said, mobile notion is severely lacking in certain features that the desktop version has. Basic features like renaming your workspace can only be done on desktop.

I recently obtained my certification from your platform, and while I appreciate the knowledge and skills I gained from the experience, I believe it's time for a change in your testing methods.

Be a rebel üëá <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd This allows us - in theory - to browse any website.
(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""
Install it. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry ""Custom Frames"" (towards end of your list)
Find the ""New Frame"" button and click it. A Frame is such a browser window, that we can use to access all of the services.
The new entry will appear in the list above the button. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL (<STRICT_LINK>, <STRICT_LINK> or <STRICT_LINK> - copy &amp; paste from Browser)
2 ‚úÖ ""open in center"" to open the service like a tab (otherwise it's in the sidebar)
3 ‚úÖ ""Add Ribbon Icon"" to display a side icon. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Specify the icon you want to use.
Go to <STRICT_LINK> and find an icon you like.
Copy paste it's name into the ""icon"" textfield in previous step. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left.
You will have to log in to Google/Apple/Evernote/... the first time. But then it will remember you. (Just like in a browser)
On the top right you find a few buttons, to reload the page. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Summary:
‚ñ∫ Download ""Custom Frames"" plugin
‚ñ∫ Add frames to any website, as Obsidian is technically a browser.
‚ñ∫ This technique works with ANY website. So you can integrate google calendar, facebook or a todo app into obsidian!

Be a rebel üëá <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd This allows us - in theory - to browse any website.
(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""
Install it. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry ""Custom Frames"" (towards end of your list)
Find the ""New Frame"" button and click it. A Frame is such a browser window, that we can use to access all of the services.
The new entry will appear in the list above the button. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL (<STRICT_LINK>, <STRICT_LINK> or <STRICT_LINK> - copy &amp; paste from Browser)
2 ‚úÖ ""open in center"" to open the service like a tab (otherwise it's in the sidebar)
3 ‚úÖ ""Add Ribbon Icon"" to display a side icon. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Specify the icon you want to use.
Go to <STRICT_LINK> and find an icon you like.
Copy paste it's name into the ""icon"" textfield in previous step. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left.
You will have to log in to Google/Apple/Evernote/... the first time. But then it will remember you. (Just like in a browser)
On the top right you find a few buttons, to reload the page. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Summary:
‚ñ∫ Download ""Custom Frames"" plugin
‚ñ∫ Add frames to any website, as Obsidian is technically a browser.
‚ñ∫ This technique works with ANY website. So you can integrate google calendar, facebook or a todo app into obsidian!

User: There's literature search tools, note taking tools, brainstorming tools, editing tools, time management tools, citation tools, tools linking among tools. And new ones every day.
They are good. But do you need to use them all?
No you don't.
Should you try some of them?
Sure!
User: There is something like tech procrastination. You can go down rabbit holes of tool use, trying new ones, listening to more YouTube tutorials, subscribing to more newsletters.
But in the end, you still need to do the work as a researcher. Nothing can replace thinking, lab work.
User: So try new things out, and if it makes sense for you, the way you work, the way you think, your topic, your personal preferences - fine! But you shouldn't feel like you're falling behind if you're not trying out every new thing out there.
User: This is not anti-tech at all, I love exploring new things. But they really can be a distraction. The FOMO is real. They are time drains. There are costs.
So, do your work. Do your research. And sample these new tools every once in a while...but don't procrastinate with tech.

Notion,Twitter,"User: After using the #AI tool for a while, I ran into some issues and also found some tools/platforms suitable for lazy people:
Let's read the conclusion first. I recommend the @poe_platform platform. The supported bots are also quite rich. There are no IP requirements, and if you have advanced requirements, you can directly subscribe on the Poe platform.
#ChatGPT <STRICT_LINK>
User: Currently, I mainly use Claude's robot on the Poe platform. Here's a summary of the advantages I've discovered:
1) Responses will be faster than #ChatGPT in Chinese conversations
2) The corpus will be updated in due course. I don't know the frequency, but at least he can help me sort out the relatively new content #Layer2 and @Starknet
3) Writing and copywriting skills seem to be stronger than ChatGPT (subjective feeling
Let's take a look at other AI tool products in detail:
User: 1chatGPT
There are strict restrictions on IP, and a global proxy+privacy window must be attached to it before it can be used;
There are unstable situations. For example, I went to WeChat to send a message to him halfway through the conversation, and when I came back, I had to refresh the page before I could use it;
There are occasional interruptions in answering, so I need to remind him to continue.
In the end, he blocked me, which is the biggest problem with using it so far. ü•∂
<STRICT_LINK>
User: 2Google Bard Google fought back against OpenAI's products. Currently, I haven't been able to experience them due to IP issues, so I abandoned them according to the purpose of our lazy people. According to feedback from some friends, there is still a certain gap between product power and ChatGPT.
<STRICT_LINK>
User: 3Claude
The founder is the former executive vice president of OpenAI. This product is very popular in the investment community. It's a bit like the capital that didn't invest in Tesla back then placed a heavy bet on Lucid
It's currently completely free to use, and supports use of <STRICT_LINK> on Poe and #Slack
User: 4Poe
This is an integrated platform made by @Quora that supports mainstream AI conversation tools. GPT-4 and Claude+ paid subscriptions are also supported.
It's the best tool/platform to use so far, and you can use it without having to connect to a global agent or open a ladder.
<STRICT_LINK>
User: 5BuddyGPT
This is a GPT robot on #Telegram, which will be more friendly to heavy TG users. There's a free version, but it only supports 10 free messages per month, and the subscription costs ‚Ç¨5.99/month.
<STRICT_LINK>
User: 6Defalsh
Web3 content aggregation platform with GPT as the information processing engine.
There is no need to register, and you can use it with authorization through the Metamask wallet. Although the introduction says ‚ÄúWeb3 content aggregation platform‚Äù, it doesn't seem to support on-chain data retrieval yet, so I'm still looking forward to them becoming a Web3 one-stop search engine.

Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)
<STRICT_LINK>
User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space?

Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!

User: 2. @MiroHQ 
I've been using Miro for everything lately: product briefs, data analyses, brainstorming, mockups. 
It's a tool that can do a ton of things well, and helps make visuals much easier to consume vs. a document.
User: 3. Looker
We've used Looker for several years, and it's our go-to spot for building reports and dashboards.
Our core team dashboard and pricing/conversion dashboards both live here, and I check each daily.
User: 4. @Amplitude_HQ 
For product analytics, we use Amplitude. Looker gives me high-level business metrics; Amplitude gives me the details.
We use this for understanding the user behavior behind the metrics.
User: 5. @CrazyEgg &amp; @hotjar 
Two tools that do similar things: we use one for our website and one for our app.
These give us even more qualitative data behind our metrics, with things like heat maps and screen recordings.
User: 6. @SlackHQ 
I barely use email any more, and while the Slack overload is real, it does enable fast async communication among our teams, wherever we are.
It's also great for consolidating notifications from other tools (Asana, Google Docs, etc.) if you set up the integrations.
User: 7. @Officevibe 
Our HR team implemented this tool, and as PM, it gives me a bunch of metrics about how my team is doing.

figma,Twitter,"User: I‚Äôve been a designer for a little over 13 years. Early in my design career, I started feeling like I wanted a more ‚Äòtechnical role‚Äô and switched to front-end development.
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for meüí°
User: At the time, I was building custom WordPress themes. 
Within my theme, I'd have a partials folder, full of my silly little components.
And I had my templates folder, full of my silly little templates.
User: Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular, maintainable and organised template files.
Seeing it all come together was a huge a-ha moment for me, but I didn't know why ‚Äì¬†at the time, design systems wasn't a well-known concept.
User: I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass, extending classes, using mixins, and all that fun, CSS goodness.
‚úΩ
Looking back at it now, I realise that what I was really (kind of) doing, was implementing a simplified version of component properties.
User: Code felt natural and intuitive ‚Äì I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly.
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly. But design tooling wasn't anywhere close to what it is now.
User: Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying, pasting and replacing... The process felt outdated and ineffective, and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies.
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code... even the tiniest bit.
User: When I learned about Figma a few years later, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted, and my passion for design exploded.
I'm so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly, and some of the gaps between design/dev are starting to thin out.
User: This was a lot of tweets about nothing, but I woke up feeling so in love with my career. 
And just generally grateful that I get to sit around all day, working on design systems, architecting components, crafting design patterns and collaborating with developers. üòçü•∞ü•π

figma,Twitter,"User: We‚Äôre working on a larger Component library that includes non-published components (components with the prefix _ or .) as base components in order to simplify large, complex components. We intended ‚Äì in some specific cases ‚Äì to offer regular components as templates, that a designer would then have to detach and work with a bunch of base components to build the desired design.
What we have come to realize with this approach, however, is that these non-published components don‚Äôt receive updates from the library when they are updated in the main library.
Is this intended behaviour?
We basically have the option to simply publish these base components as regular components, but that of course would mean cluttering up the assets overview with a bunch of modular components.

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi,
Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior. I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a ‚ÄúSpecial offer‚Äù label placed inside the picture.
In order to reproduce the issue:
Step 1: Create a text field, turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color, just to create a label basically, like ‚ÄúFLASH SALE‚Äù etc‚Ä¶
Step 2: Add a rectangle and fill it with an image.
Step 3: Turn both into an Auto-Layout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside. While doing so, you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it, even when the label layer is above the image.
Despite that, when merging a text and an image into Auto-Layout and only then turning the text to Auto-Layout as well to give if a fill color - this method works perfectly fine, but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned, so there might be a bug here. Or is it?

When giving ‚Äúpadding‚Äù on Figma auto-layout to a button, the text position (inside the box, not the box) is not in the centre height. In the following example, you can see that in one font type there is 2 px space at the bottom and 1 at the top and in the other one, 2px at the top and 1 at the bottom.
That‚Äôs led to; 1, the text is not in the centre height, 2, the padding is getting extra which then lead to the wrong implementation.
Later on CSS, the text div won‚Äôt behave like that and will wrap right around the text.
The ideal is that the space (padding) above and below the text is even and exactly as set in the padding.

User: Hi @Tsasqa_Galih ,
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files?
If this is happening on a specific file, then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits.
Figma is a browser-based app, which means it‚Äôs subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab, including those in our Desktop App. When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit, it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes.
I recommend you to:
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages (for example by splitting a page into multiple pages) will usually help with rendering performance.
Hidden layers: loading and then hiding a large number of layers, especially in components or with images stored in them, can cause a high use of available memory on loading.
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load.
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again.
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows, you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here. Hope it helps!

There is an interesting concept in Figma that‚Äôs used and was presented by multiple people and has different names: Placeholder, Slots, Dummies, Layout Blocks, and so on:
‚ùñ Placeholder component is the base one.
‚óá Placeholder instances may be nested into another ‚ùñ Component.
‚óá Placeholder instances nested into ‚óá Component instances may be swapped with any other component instances‚Ä¶

Users will create their own personal access tokens, which will be inserted into the input field of your plugin.

User: @Raffaele_Parlato I‚Äôm not exactly sure what the issue is here with the scrolling, (I‚Äôm just guessing the system adds the shadow to the size of the cards) but I also found another problem with this which is the shadows actually overlap on one another (although it may not seem so, I used the colorpicker to test). but when you group them together, the shadows are always at the bottom and do not go over other cards."," Pasting to replace an existing component from Figma to FigJam causes the object to shift its position, which is especially annoying when creating flow diagrams.

figma,G2,"User: It's the go-to design tool in our team. It responds to all wireframing, prototyping, and design requirements and facilitates team collaboration. It also comes with Figjam, and eliminates need for other whiteboarding tools.
User: It's easy to get started with Figma, and its robust community means there are tons of resources and plugins to inspire and help speed up your design process (and there are some incredible plugins out there)!
User: There isn't much to dislike, but there are a few inconveniences. First, everything is online so you need a strong internet connection, especially when dealing with large files. Second, the way plugins are handled can feel a bit clunky (you have to look for it, save/run it, and it opens as a separate window - wish there was a way to anchor it). Third, it might just be me but I always get confused navigating within the community section... but again these are just minor inconveniences and the pros far outweigh the cons.","User appreciates Figma's seamless screen creation and cloud collaboration features, but requests an increase in the number of pages available in the free version."
figma,G2,"User: Practically everything, my daily life as a UX Designer requires a platform like Figma. There I can do prototyping, a flowchart and I can practically do the entire development process.
User: Figma is the best tool for software designers and developers. It's practical and complete. We can design a pixel-perfect responsive web app design. It has several collaboration features and several plugins. It is even using the free option that the person makes a profit.
User: There aren't many cons. But I would say that sometimes, Figma can be slow, especially when working with large files or complex projects. What about the issue of limited offline functionality","Users find FigJam to be an excellent tool for UX design and team collaboration in remote work environments, as it allows them to visually map out workflows, track comments and changes, and collaborate effectively with various team members."
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration with the team. Everyone working on the same page using the chat/audio feature helps us consolidate our culture of collaboration and feedback. While using components, I don't need to adjust all the designs because of project scope changes. So, it saves time and money and helps the team with problems with miscommunication.
User: Collaboration in real-time and features like components properties save much time.
User: I want analytics of the components usage for design systems governance and metrics, but i don't have it in the professional plan.","Figma helps designers, tech and product managers collaborate and conduct workshops, streamlining the design process and facilitating brainstorming. Users appreciate predefined post-its, shapes, comment tracking, and team calling sessions. However, improvements are needed in the mobile app, color customization for post-it notes, and document imports."
figma,G2,"User: It gives our design team an easy to use whiteboard app where we can brainstorm and participate in other team activities
User: I love all the collaboration features and the great UX. Every part of the app is very thoughtfully designed and delightful to use.
User: There are so many little features everywhere that it can be hard to remember where to find things. I don't use it every day and spend most of my time in Figma","The design team finds Figma easy to use, with good documentation and training available, allowing them to design user journeys and feature mocks efficiently. The tool's organization and sharing capabilities are appreciated. However, one user found it challenging to learn the controls for navigation and zooming, suggesting a potential improvement in user onboarding."
figma,G2,"User: When we need a meeting, we always decide to use Miro. And this is a standard in our way of working, even if we are all in the same room. The reason is that Miro has been instrumental in brainstorming until we reach agreements that we all like. The methodology has made the meetings less time-consuming and more effective.
User: The fluidity of the application is out of this world. Thanks to it, we can create structures while meeting without waiting for changes. In addition, it's easy to use, so anyone can master it and get a lot out of it to express their ideas.
User: Miro works perfectly, thanks to the fact that it is online, but this is a drawback if the connection is unstable. Therefore, I would like some measures so that the unstable connection does not affect the experience so much.","Users appreciate Miro's collaborative diagramming and simple workflow/mindmap creation without needing to download software. They also find it easy to use and enjoy the ability to connect boxes and interfaces. However, they are frustrated by the inability to export their work to PowerPoint for presentations"
figma,G2,"User: Before starting each project, I meet with my clients to know what they want. To do this, we connect through Miro and create a dashboard to facilitate these explanations so that what is most important is recorded. 
The result of this session is what I use as a basis for the approach of the project in question virtual office.
User: Miro's navigation was the reason why I decided to use it. It is so good that anyone can adapt to the software with a couple of simple directions. 
I love that the templates can be modified with a few clicks to suit the moment's needs. 
And their visuals are lovely, complete and easy to understand.
User: Miro has no fundamental weaknesses. It is software that does what it is supposed to do. If it is necessary to use other apps, it is because Miro is not designed for it.","Users appreciate Figma's remote collaboration capabilities, Jira card integration, canvas design, and various features such as templates, app integrations, presentation tools, and AI components. However, they experience issues when sharing boards with free license users who need to actively collaborate."
figma,G2,"User: Right now, we're just using it as a retro board to evaluate that week's sprint. It allows us to contribute our ideas and feedback for future improvements easily.
User: FigJam is super easy to use, especially if you have experience with Figma. But even if you don't anyone can use it. It's also great that the realtime UI works so flawlessly.
User: There's not a lot to dislike about FigJam since it just provides the UI and you give it the content. One thing I dislike is that they took away the mini snake game. That was a blast.","Users appreciate Miro for its seamless team communication and collaboration capabilities, as well as its ease in managing agile workflows and projects. They find it simple to create, edit, and share whiteboards, brainstorm ideas, and run online meetings and workshops. However, stable internet connectivity is essential for optimal performance."
figma,G2,"User: Miro has been good at creating good visuals. They are helpful when I have to explain how we will work from that point on. The meetings are organic, quite explanatory and very light. 
 
On the other hand, it has been my primary tool for creating complex work paths. 
 
Our communication and environment have improved.
User: Miro has tools I love: brainstorming, polls, sticky notes, mapping, etc. They all have a lovely design that makes them easy to use. I also love how fluid the app is. It feels great to use all its functions from any device.
User: I have no problem with Miro. If I had to mention one, there is not much variety of licenses, even if a person uses fundamental functions. But I like enterprise plans.","Users appreciate Figma's flexibility and features for remote collaboration, especially the advanced board functions. However, they suggest integrating data upload and merging capabilities with Excel to enhance the tool's usefulness in large companies."
figma,G2,"User: Miro has become our virtual office since we started telecommuting. It has been the best choice for us. 
 
We use Miro to exchange ideas, visualize data in user-friendly formats and plan some processes.
User: Miro excellently simulates a whiteboard to create a virtual space that I really like. I can hardly feel the difference between this software and the whiteboard I have in my office. 
 
Thus, the platform has become an ideal virtual office for real-time collaboration. 
 
Some features like sticky notes, surveys and polls enhance the experience.
User: The categorization of the boards is complicated. I am still looking for a way to sort them out that I like. However, the performance and features keep me sticking with this software.","Users appreciate Figma Jam's customizable templates and intuitive interface, which make it easy to explore new ideas in a collaborative environment. However, being an internet-dependent tool, some users may experience latency or connectivity issues that can hinder collaboration."
figma,G2,"User: Need a way to visualize our processes, organize wireframes for presentations, documentation of software
User: I like how easy it is to use for everyone and even that they have templates that can help you springboard on a project faster.
User: Sometimes navigation isn't always good with zooming in and out.","Users appreciate Miro's ability to facilitate remote workshops during the pandemic, making it easy for new users to start and offering helpful templates. However, they experience slow initial loading times for boards."
figma,G2,"User: I usually have to make presentations to my clients to let them know how the progress of the projects has been going. I used Powerpoint and other similar software because they are pretty well known. 
However, Miro has been great for making these presentations because it is easier to use.
User: Miro has fascinating visuals. The board is a perfect virtual space to dump images and others to communicate ideas. 
 
I also love how interactive the software is. I especially see this when I think of it as a virtual whiteboard
User: Browsing is a bit tedious when too much content is on the same board. It would be interesting to have filters or something similar for these cases. Sometimes, I use more than an unique space for big projects.","Users find Miro helpful for structuring ideas and engaging with clients in business discovery sessions, praising its seamless collaborative user experience. However, they suggest improving navigation by making it more intuitive to move around the board."
figma,G2,"User: Miro supports our team as a platform for digital collaboration -- it facilitates hybrid work, transitioning our information from the remote environment into the office and back.
User: Having worked in mixed creative, product, and engineering teams, I find Miro an effective tool for visual thinking and documentation. The tools are accessible for newcomers to adopt but scale well for power users to leverage templates and tools that adapt to content and user needs across a project or workflow's stages.
User: Whether at the board-level, or the team-level, it's up to individuals and their teams to manage board sprawl and keep things organized. Depending on the information guidelines of your organization, there may be some friction involved in ensuring that the right individuals are granted the correct level of access to certain types of content in a timely manner.","Users find Figma valuable for replacing physical whiteboards in discovery and brainstorming sessions, as well as for teambuilding and engagement during meetings. It is user-friendly, intuitive, and compatible with other tools. However, some users face challenges with overlapping toolboxes and sharing options, especially for external or infrequent users."
figma,G2,"User: Helps us create some timelines for yearly demands for our ecommerce clients, helps me visualize everything with images etc in a single place, it's pretty intuitive to use too (although not in the super advanced level of the stuff they offer).
User: Possibility to model everything exactly the way I want, like a super powerful Whiteboard, that allows me to see whatever I want combined in whichever way I want.
User: It's super powerful, but I never use the templates that they suggest whenever creating a new file, it's like these templates never fully fill out the needs I'm looking for so I end up creating everything from scratch.","User appreciates Figma's collaborative function and diverse design tools while building department plans and company strategies. However, they face issues with the drag-and-drop feature, as items tend to fall out of the grid when moved with the pointer."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is helping us to work remotely by helping us to collaborate more efficiently. It is easier to gather feedback in user research using Miro. We are using Miro to conduct our Sprint Retrospectives, which provides many inbuilt templates. After any workshop or interview the outputs are summarised in Miro and it is reviewed within team virtually without having to schedule any meeting.
User: It helps teams to collaborate efficiently and exchange ideas. It acts as a virtual whiteboard and allows teams in different parts of the globe to interact and exchange ideas.
User: Lots of features and difficult to lock frames.",Users appreciate Figma's ease of use and aesthetics but face challenges in distributing information effectively when working remotely with cross-functional teams. They also experience occasional sluggishness and lag when loading boards and moving flows.
figma,G2,"User: The use of MIRO in active collaboration during meetings. Mapping out long strategic vision and being able to have a common place for people to reference is invaluable.
User: Using the tool live to collaborate and being able to have asynchronous collaboration in a common space is a great advantage.
User: The template library could be more comprehensive. Sometimes i cannot find good examples of common business work flows.","Users appreciate Miro's simplicity, templates, real-time collaboration, and ample workspace for brainstorming and problem-solving. However, they feel that Miro offers more tools and integration options, suggesting that easy access of Miro use could be beneficial"
figma,G2,"User: A perfect collaborative whiteboarding tool is a rare find. FigJam solved most of our team's problems. I can now keep all my important files organised in a single figma account and create different teams + edit my figma designs and get the feedback on my design in the quickest way.
User: I remember using Figma as a collaborative whiteboarding tool for my team since all the other such apps weren't as engaging. Then came FigJam and we couldn't stop using it because it is an extremely powerful tool with the most complex tools put in the simplest ways. Love its UI the most.
User: FigJam has a list of helpful tools and is perfectly real-time. I have never faced any issues while using any of the tools, widgets or features. One thing that I want to highlight they can work upon is to add a natural smoothness slider to the pen and highlighters so it works great even on trackpads.","User finds Miro useful for collaborative activities like brainstorming and reviews, appreciating its powerful collaboration features, ease of use, and range of templates. However, they initially struggled with adding content from a template without creating a new board."
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration across multiple teams.
User: Templates, and the new Miro AI feature. These made my design process and workflow more efficient. Also somewhat easily to learn for new users.
User: Drawing lines between shapes can be tough. Tables are also clunky and hard to use."," Users appreciate Figma as a collaboration platform for geographically dispersed teams, finding it useful for project and strategy planning. They recommend wider adoption to increase its usefulness across communities."
figma,G2,"User: Ability to map and create beautiful CX artefacts.
User: Features, usability, Miroverse, templates and support.
User: It is a pricey product, and it would be great to invite guest users for free for the first 24 hours.","Users appreciate Figma as an effective collaboration tool for brainstorming and visually representing ideas on a massive, easily accessible canvas. However, they experience slow loading times on the desktop app and frequent login prompts, even on registered devices."
figma,G2,"User: I would otherwise be doing the same in Figma, but Miro is quicker allowing me to type in the shapes and connect arrows and lines to shapes. The arrow/lines will anchor to the shape, which mapes it really easy to move shapes (notes) around the board without having to grab the whole shape/line, like I would in Figma.
User: I like that you can easily plot out ideas through notes or shapes with the handy arrows/lines that connect them together. I also like to use templates, as then I don't need to create new templates or copy them from other miro boards.
User: I find grouping objects and selecting objects within the group a bit cumbersom. I also don't like that when I trpe within a box/shape, that there isn't much padding between the text and the edge of the shape, the text can bud right up next to the edge which I find strange.","The user appreciates Figma's accessibility on any device and its ease of use, but suggests improving the grid system by incorporating a more structured format, similar to Excel."
figma,G2,"User: Facilitating brainstorming exercises with multiple people in various locations allows me the ability to take in ideas from all voices at the table. The visuals also help guide current activities.
User: Being able to seamlessly whiteboard and collaborate with multiple users across multiple locations. The idea-sharing process becomes more fair and democratic when everyone's voice is incorporated.
User: I get hung up on the UI sometimes as it's a new way of navigating and point/click/drag. It just takes some getting used to! The zooming in and out feature is also a little funky and I have not quite mastered the sizing for what ever I am trying to work on or design.","Users appreciate Miro for enabling large and remote teams to collaborate effectively, especially in a work-from-home environment. However, they find that the loading speed of the Miro board can be slow and frustrating, depending on its size"
figma,G2,"User: It really helps with strategy visuals and telling the story of why work is important. It also helps to organize information when needed. I love the ability to create to-dos for areas of my business and represent it in one place.
User: The visualization ability to convey a story. I appreciate the open-source templates. I can use it for almost anything from planning a baby shower to road mapping a development team's work.
User: I don't like how you can't format a shape to mimic another. Sometimes the table formatting doesn't work right. I can't add a row of cells to the top of a table, only below. I wish you could designate that connecting lines don't intersect, and if you have to pull a point to make the connecting lines not intersect, they smooth out so the line doesn't look so jagged. Also, do you have a critical path template? If not, that would also be very helpful.","Users appreciate Figma's easy-to-use and intuitive diagramming features for various business scenarios, enabling interactive and collaborative work. However, they find the sharing process to be somewhat confusing at times."
figma,G2,"User: The ability to churn through large amounts of data, draw correlations and glean new insights. Having all information in one place within a visually stimulating format helps explore information in a way not possible via standard means.
User: Very simple and intuitive - the ability for all information in one place with an unlimited whiteboard space - great for collaboration and forming new ideas and making insights
User: Can become slightly clunky when uploading multiple files - some PDFs prove hard for read. I have to continually keep logging in on my work account if it has been inactive for a short while","Users appreciate Figma's collaborative whiteboard feature, flexibility in adding people to projects, and the ability to log in from anywhere. However, they suggest adding more libraries/packages for a funkier experience."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is digital with a large canvas to accommodate for elaborate drawings and collection of information.
User: Miro is a digital white-boarding tool that allows collaborating with colleagues to express and share ideas. It is suitable for brainstorming and collecting thoughts.
User: I am unsure if some kind of versioning is supported or organization of information. It appears to be a single white board.","Figma is praised for its virtual workshop capabilities, allowing multiple users to contribute live and offering a voting option for instant feedback. However, it can be slow when multiple users are active."
figma,G2,"User: Being able to look realtime at our collections and work collaboratively when not in the office
User: I love how easy it is to collaborate with my design team and other teammates
User: I wish we could link Miro to adobe products for an auto update to our product","Users appreciate Miro for mapping user flows and processes, collaboration and sharing insights with features like sticky notes and unlimited space. However, they find accessing boards in their organization time-consuming due to sharing restrictions"
figma,G2,"User: It solves the need to have to use multiple tools to collaborate and capture different requires that all feed into building the right product for our customers
User: It is a blank white board that allows you to easily collaborate with team members, organize workflows, capture user journeys and use existing templates
User: I wish it would be easier to copy and paste excel spreadsheets","Users find FigJam helpful for visualizing complex information, sketching ideas in low fidelity, and collaborating with non-designer colleagues. However, they wish there was an option to invite participants to edit files without requiring a licensed seat, as it can be challenging to grant temporary access for interactive workshops."
figma,G2,"User: Our company has people working all over the globe, so a tool that facilitates virtual meetings is essential. With Miro, we can have brainstorming, plan activities throughout the year and manage our customer journey map.
User: The numerous possibilities that we can use during virtual meetings. Miro has become part of our routine; we can organize processes and brainstorm meetings. Our 2023 plan was also structured with Miro.
User: Some features are not intuitive so it may take you a while to master the tool, but after you've learned it, it will be a lot easier to organize and share information","Users find FigJam helpful for working through complex product logic with clients and internal decision-making. They appreciate its ability to optimize processes and facilitate collaboration with external partners. However, they suggest having two versions: one for product decision-making and a simpler, live version for meetings with less tech-savvy individuals."
figma,G2,"User: As a Scrum Master I use Miro religiously for our retrospectives. Compared to other applications this has helped my team stay the most engaged, while also getting the most feedback from my teams.
User: I love the available templates that I can use on Miro. I generally use Miro for retrospectives and icebreakers that promote team building. It is intuitive, has many valuable integrations, and constantly adds new features.
User: All of the best features are locked by the pro version, which is understandable, but would be great to have a free trial. Also, dark mode would also be a nice feature!","Users find Miro ideal for collecting feedback on wireframe designs and collaborating with team members, as it is flexible, easy to use, and has intuitive keyboard shortcuts. However, it lacks BPMN symbols and swimlane structures, making it less suitable for process mapping compared to Visio."
figma,G2,"User: We use it for all types of mapping, flow design, brainstorming, continuous flow improvement and project monitoring, and even for a moment of rotation with the Team.
User: Everything is in hand very agile and easy to apply and the way to interact with other people in the same document at the same time, this is fantastic, I would recommend it to all friends
User: Everything is very good and easy, but it could have other translations such as Portuguese would be less difficult for those who don't speak English, but that doesn't interfere with its usability.","Users find Miro helpful for planning learning & development strategies and yearly timelines, as well as facilitating group work. They appreciate its interactivity but mention that it can be difficult for beginners due to its lack of intuitiveness"
figma,G2,"User: FigJam helps fill the gap between collaborating and working remotely. It allows our team to 'whiteboard' together without being in the same room - and not lose value from doing so.
User: FigJam is easy to jump into and get value out of, even when unfamiliar with the tool. The entire product team has found value in it for collaboration - from quick brainstorm sessions to workshops.
User: I wish transferring things from FigJam over to an actual Figma file was easier. I like to have the entire narrative of how a final design came to be within the Figma file; the sessions on FigJam are part of that.","Users find Figma convenient for remote collaboration and managing a large number of boards, as well as its integration with Microsoft Suits. However, they suggest improving the PDF and image export feature to maintain the board's appearance and make it easier to view large-scale work results."
figma,G2,"User: There is a lot of things it benefits me at work. It's a simpler design tool when compared to other Adobe tools. I can complete my task faster than using other tools. And sharing my work with other parties and communicating/commenting on my work is much easier when using Fimga.
User: There is a lot of features it's better than many other similar tools. But if I have to pick one, I think it must be the ""Share"" function. It's by default a web-based tool. Though it provides a desktop application, I mainly use the web version. Sharing my work with different parties is just never easier than before, owing to its web-based nature.
User: ""PDF to Figma"", it is a real problem for many designers. Currently, figma doesn't natively support drag & drop PDF into a design file. It needs a plugin to do that. Hopefully, we can have such native function soon.","Users appreciate Figma's ease of use and collaborative whiteboarding features, but some find it slow and sluggish at times."
figma,G2,"User: figJam lets me put my ideas out for others to easily see.
User: FigJam is easy to use once you get the hang of it.
User: FigJam is not as intuitive as it should be. Some features are hard to find throughout the menus.","The user appreciates Figma's intuitive UI/UX and its ability to facilitate collaboration within their design team, acting as a design repository. They find it easy to use with ready-made templates, but suggest adding step-by-step guides or pop-up tips for non-professional designers."
figma,G2,"User: It helps us create and share designs with pre-populated templates, collaborate and discuss with the team and maintain discussion notes.
User: Easy to navigate and understand various tools and options, drag and drop options makes it easier and more efficient, also good with integrations.
User: Templates are limited and need more use cases, and better search option to find the available features or may be a help option which can navigate the user to the right option.","The user finds Miro effective for remote whiteboarding and easy to use for non-technical marketing teams, replacing in-person sessions. However, they mention that it can be overwhelming for new users."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam has helped solve the problem of real-time collaboration with my team in a virtual setting.
User: What is most helpful with FigJam is the ability to layout work in a whiteboard style and make edits/comments with your team in real-time
User: What can sometimes be an issue with FigJam is that the designs can be more limited on FigJam vs. Figma","Users appreciate Miro for collaboration and personal project planning, as it consolidates multiple tools into one platform. However, finding the right template can be challenging, requiring users to try multiple options before settling on one."
figma,G2,"User: We are a fully remote and distributed team, so collaboration across distances is the main problem it quickly solves. The other is its potential - I use it to solve literally any problem I encounter - either with a quick brainstorming session or a more thought out workshop.
User: How quickly it is to add ideas to the space using stickies. The increase in plugins for different tasks and processes. The collaborative aspects and how fun it is.
User: The only downsides that come to mind are the limitations regarding font selection or shape creation, etc. If it had a few more capabilities like Figma (with a different editing experience) it'd be versatile enough for pretty much all tasks, rather than having to jump back and forth between Figma and Figjam to do some tasks","User finds Figma easy to use and appreciates the intuitive tools and base models for diagrams. However, they are limited to one team project without paying and would like more settings for some tools."
figma,G2,"User: Helps quickly get ideas out and keep everyone on the same page.
User: FigJam is intuitive and easy to use, even for non-designers. It's great to use with clients or internal teams to run brainstorms and retros. It has great features like stickers, timers etc that make creating collaborative sessions simple.
User: FigJam can be hard to customize to look clean and polished ‚Äì it's not necessarily the core use case, it's meant to be casual, but it can sometimes be frustrating when trying to use it for more professional meetings or touchpoints.","Users appreciate Miro for its collaboration and visibility features, allowing them to store various formats of work and share them with stakeholders or teammates. However, they face challenges in managing multiple open Miro tabs and wish for a better organization system or quick access to specific boards."
figma,G2,"User: It makes collaboration and meetings super easy and fun and helps to understand the bigger picture
User: I love the brainstorming templates and the stickers and that you can follow another person wherever they are navigating
User: No dislikes as of now but if we can find who posted what sticker than it will be great","Miro provides a collaborative workspace for team members to share and work on designs, saving time and improving efficiency. The user prefers working in Illustrator or InDesign for creating templates, as it takes more time to align artboards perfectly."
figma,G2,"User: Figjam is helping me to improve my collaboration with my team and my customers. We usually use it to work with corporations or startups.
User: I love how easy is. Me and my team use it everyday.
User: Probably more features ib FigJam, but that's ok for having everything in one platform","Users find Miro extremely helpful for remote meetings and workshops, as it enables simultaneous collaboration among large teams and effectively conveys ideas using boards and clustering objects. They appreciate its ease of use and comprehensive feature set, making it difficult to suggest areas for improvement."
figma,G2,"User: Great for group collaboration in real-time and working together remotely.
User: Like how Figjam files and Figma files live together and not in different tools.
User: It can be difficult for non-design teams to get their head around.","The user finds Miro useful for product management tasks, including collaborative wireframing, mind mapping, and sprint retrospectives. They appreciate the ease of use and the collaborative features. However, they find it difficult to organize their boards into a folder structure and find the organizational structure lacking."
figma,G2,"User: It is providing a cloud based collaboration tool with multiple features within that can be of benefit to all type of roles within a team. Downloading the board also helps share it with those who don't have access to it immediately.
User: It's a very powerful tool for collaboration remotely across different teams. It's whiteboard nature gives it the flexibility to use it the way you want. Be it for project management or creating process flows. 
The pre-existing templates on Miro are also very useful for quick to do boards
User: Sometimes the page refreshing takes time when it's opened up after a while. Seems like a slow process. 
Also there is no option of creating index on the board for quick navigation across different components within.","Users find Figma beneficial for solving process issues, generating ideas, and collaborating between teams, especially during the pandemic. However, they find the licensing process tedious, as limited licenses restrict collaboration, forcing them to use personal email accounts for free versions and later transfer to paid versions to access all features."
figma,G2,"User: Key problem we solve with Miro is to identify and articulate ideas and concepts. From there, we can easily shuffle each concept around to make it easier to understand what we want to achieve.
User: Love the collaboration online. It is simple and easy to use. 
Love the ability to create easy to use brainstorming ideas - especially when you integrate in frames for different sections so you can set it up to tell a story or journey
User: Miro is quite expensive as you pay for each user. Ideally we would like to have the ability to share Miro boards that are read only without the need to consume an additional license","Users appreciate Miro as a collaboration tool, highlighting its ease of use and collaborative features. They find it helpful for engaging with teammates and using it as a mind mapping and brainstorming board application. However, some users mention that it can be initially confusing for new users, but becomes easier with time."
figma,G2,"User: Since my company is completely remote, it is a great team brainstorming/team activity tool
User: I can copy and paste everything from FigJam to Figma files, and all those are editable
User: Maybe if there is a way to quickly organize all notes/writings on the FigJam and transform everything into organized docs format","Users find FigJam essential for remote communication, collaboration, and alignment, particularly in organizing and structuring UX research activities. However, they wish the Tables feature was more flexible for complex tasks."
figma,G2,"User: I'm a visual person so I like being able to map everything out and share my thoughts with colleagues. In previous roles, I had to use free tools that lacked a lot of features that FigJam has.
User: I love being able to collaborate with colleagues in a visual way so we can easily problem-solve. And make actionable next steps.
User: It took some time to get used to all of the features","Users find Figma's discussion board useful for remote sessions and appreciate the ability to copy-paste components or designs. However, they mention that the need to pay extra for collaborators limits its accessibility for everyone."
figma,G2,"User: We use it weekly to review creative assets and work flows.
User: I enjoy the ease of creating white boards to create moodboards and presentations for collaborative purposes.
User: I dislike that it's hard to find the option to add a link or import an image. It takes a few steps to find those options, in addition creating a clipping mask into a shape can also become difficult.","The user finds Figma useful for diagramming processes, ideas, and mapping, but suggests integrating it with other platforms such as Flaticon, Dale, ChatGPT, and others."
figma,G2,"User: A simple whiteboard tool within the Figma console to keep things organized is good and easily copy and paste into Figma to make progress
User: Fairly easy to use and quick to on board
User: The cost, when it was a free plan at the beginning I utilize it more with other team. 
Sometimes connecting arrow back in reverse is a bit ""tricky"" or it's easy to connect the other way I was trying to do","Users appreciate Figma's Figjam for its real-time collaboration, commenting system, and file management, which enhance teamwork and idea visualization. However, they find multi-account management and navigating multiple workspaces challenging, making the daily experience difficult."
figma,G2,"User: It's a highly collaborative tool that doesn't feel formal; it's not a deck, but can be used to communicate the same information, and there are lots of fun stickers to spice up casual work sessions.
User: It's awesome that FigJam is built in with Figma and it's so highly collaborative. No need for a separate ecosystem. 
 
Love these product features: timer, spotlighting users to see their view of the screen, stickers, auto-align tools and guides, variety of community templates available.
User: Mindmaps are more difficult compared to competitors (ie, Miro). It's difficult to connect words into a cohesive web. 
 
When mood boarding and importing a bunch of images, it doesn't auto-resize photos into a neat masonry layout with consistent sizing like competitors (ie, Pinterest and InVision). 
 
Even though FigJam isn't for video calling, because it's so collaborative, I wish there was a chat feature like other online video call apps.","Users find Miro useful for collecting images, ideas, and communication in the architectural and interior design process, appreciating its intuitive interface and versatility. However, they wish for more robust drawing tools and a larger shape library for better free-form sketching capabilities."
figma,G2,"User: I primarily use FigJam to diagram site maps and content sections for websites.
User: It is incredibly easy to quickly get ideas out onto a board. I haven't found a diagramming/whiteboard tool that is as intuitive as FigJam.
User: While it is extremely fast and user-friendly, the types of content you can put into a FigJam board are somewhat limited.","The user finds Miro extremely helpful for collaborating and presenting information across screens, especially in a remote working environment. They appreciate the ease of use and the ability to track information and review past discussions. They also appreciate the ability to use Miro on their computer and iPad Pro, but find the software buggy and slow on the iPad. They suggest using Freeform as an alternative to Miro in offline mode."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam makes collaboration really easy when conducting remote whiteboarding sessions, and allows our team to visually document and easily share useful information.
User: I love that FigJam makes collaboration easy, engaging, and fun for users of all technical capabilities. I also love that my teammates who aren't designers or otherwise familiar with Figma have started to adopt it in their own workflows!
User: I think having some more visual options ""out of the box"" could be nice, making it easier to create a file that looks super customized, visually exciting, and aligned with our brand ID.","The user, a Design Thinking expert and UX Designer, finds Miro extremely helpful for moderating workshops, collecting information, synthesizing and visualizing insights, and creating concepts collaboratively. They appreciate its ease of use, quick onboarding, and the availability of community templates. The user has not encountered any issues and feels Miro meets all their expectations for collaborative work and workshop moderation."
figma,G2,"User: It solves the problem of ""How can cross functional partners collaborate and share ideas in one space"" and it helps us get ideas from everyone, not the most outspoken person. I also use it to quickly organize thoughts on hierarchy.
User: How playful and approachable it is when getting teammates' creativity flowing. It's nice not to feel like you must create something polished or organized, which leaves room for play and creative new ideas.
User: How separate it feels from regular Figma files. When I'm working on a project, I almost want to combine my Figma (polished design) and Figjam (user flows, brainstorm, notes, etc) into one place so I don't have to search for or reference both files","Users find Miro valuable for product management, collaboration, brainstorming, and remote work, praising its real-time collaboration feature, vast canvas space, and user-friendly interface. However, some users find the pricing structure expensive, especially for those who use it intermittently, and experience frustration with the constant signing-in when using SSO and shared boards."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam fills the role of a handful of tools we were previously using across the business. We were able to consolidate and say this is the true, approved tool across the company. It's helped teams align and ensure access across the company via single sign on. The access issues we had previously with InVision/Freehand, Miro, etc. are long gone. No more requesting to view or edit access!
User: Anyone can get in there and start using it. It's pretty intuitive and we use it all the time across many teams to collaborate, brainstorm, plan, whiteboard, etc. We also switched to using FigJam for all team retros in the company. All the templates, timer, stickers, music, and more make FigJam fun to use - but not in a way that distracts from the work.
User: I don't dislike the tool at all. I will say one pain point we ran into is that there currently isn't a way to use stickies while maintaining anonymity. Anyone can go click an icon to toggle the original authors name off and on to see who said it ‚Äì not ideal for retros BUT our account rep taught us to switch to shapes and we no longer have this problem. Would be nice to have a retro setting on a FigJam that would preserve the psychological safety of team members. We feel extremely supported by our awesome account rep.","Users appreciate Figma's ease of use for remote workshops, efficient documentation, and reusability of materials. They find the drag-and-drop feature helpful for structuring brainstorming sessions and enjoy the useful templates. However, they suggest adding a feature to transfer content to MS PowerPoint for presentations and incorporating auto-correction on Post-its."
figma,G2,"User: I use Figjam to get alignment on key initiatives and work through brainstorming sessions.
User: Easy to use and flexible for all my needs.
User: Can be hard to give access to others and sometimes it doesnt work","Users appreciate Miro's ability to facilitate synchronous and asynchronous brainstorming, as well as its wide range of templates for visualizing ideas and requirements. However, they note that it requires a good internet connection and lacks features like hatched backgrounds, compared to lighter tools like Excalidraw."
figma,G2,"User: I need a fast, easy, and collaborative way to wireframe and fat-marker sketch ideas with my design and engineering team. We also use it for retrospective meeting whiteboards
User: I love that Figjam is in the Figma suite and is so simple and easy to use. As a Product Manager, I am not adept enough at Figma to use it as a whiteboard, so I use Figjam to mock up ideas and do light wireframing before turning ideas into designs in full Figma.
User: Figjam's strength is also its weakness- it is very simple and lacks some other whiteboard features found in competing whiteboard products like Miro. If they continue adding features, I think that Figjam will be a market leader soon.","User appreciates the searchable and editable document, as it allows for easy ideation and interactive meetings. They also appreciate the fast loading time and lack of archiving features."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam makes it really easy for me, a copywriter who's also very visual, to map out my thoughts and get organized. Honestly, I don't use it often, but when I need help figuring out my thoughts in a visual way, I can't think of a better tool.
User: I'm a copywriter, and using Figma was a big learning curve for me to work with my company's designers. FigJam, on the other hand, was super easy to learn. I use it for even the simplest things like group brainstorming sessions and just mapping out my thoughts. I would say that it's a key tool in our team.
User: I can't say that I have a specific problem with FigJam. It's a great tool. I guess my only callout would be that I'd like to have more features. It's easy to use but I'm sure there are additional features you could add to make it more fun and interactive.",User appreciates Figma's simplicity and speed for brainstorming ideas with various stakeholders but finds it challenging to make changes to the flow when it's not 100% cross-functional with Figma.
figma,G2,"User: FigJam is kind of my one-stop shop for pretty much my entire research process. I use FigJam to plan studies in it with my stakeholders, take notes during user interviews, affinity diagram user insights, create final deliverables, prioritize customer feedback, etc. It would be much harder to do these things without FigJam.
User: FigJam makes collaboration with my project stakeholders engaging, easy, and fun. It's approachable and usable regardless of one's tech savvy. FigJam also allows me to perform critical UXR tasks like affinity diagramming in an efficient and visually pleasing manner. I rely heavily on FigJam in my day-to-day work and create almost all of my deliverables in it.
User: Some things in Figjam could be made more efficient. I mainly run into issues with formatting. For example, you can't easily paste Excel rows into it. I also wish you could edit text without having to perform multiple clicks to move through layers in the file (e.g., two clicks to edit text in a sticky). I understand why this exists, but it would also speed up my work process. Resizing things can also get weird sometimes (e.g., highlighting some design assets and trying to make them bigger only expands certain elements, have to manually fix).","User appreciates the visual design and prototyping features of Figma, as well as the community support and animation capabilities. They suggest adding a few more helpful features, such as repeat grid and a few others."
figma,G2,"User: ‚Ä¢ involve nonprofessionals in the collaboration and make it easy for them to understand 
‚Ä¢ communicate with my product manager easily 
‚Ä¢ I can just dump all of my thoughts into it and separate them from my design file in Figma
User: ‚Ä¢ small interesting widgets 
‚Ä¢ it provides you with ideas of how to start, how to break the ice, and what the structure of the meeting can be 
‚Ä¢ compatible with Figma
User: ‚Ä¢ I want to change the background color to black if possible 
‚Ä¢ the connector lines sometimes don't align up with others 
‚Ä¢ set up a thumbnail for Figjam 
‚Ä¢ more widget","Users appreciate FigJam's quick collaboration features for user flows and sprint retros, allowing non-designers to become power users. They enjoy the timer for timeboxing conversations and find creating user flows helpful. However, they face challenges with components, as there is no easy way to pull them in from design files, and scaling copied components is not possible, leading to more time spent switching between files."
figma,G2,"User: Our team likes to use Figjam primarily because it's provided by Figma. We use Figma for design anyway, so its handy to have Figma provide an internal whiteboarding/collaboration tool without us having to create account & learn another platform.
User: What I like about Figjam is that it's easy to use and provides some templates (with instructions) so that teams can get onboarded quickly and start collaborating. I've used Figjam with other designers and also with non-design/tech team members, and we've benefitted tremendously from using Figjam as a fun collaboration tool.
User: While I like that Figjam provides basic tools for brainstorming and real-time collaboration, I sometimes find it can be too limiting. I wish there were more customization options related to shapes, colours, and fonts, so that my teammates and I can explore crude wireframes that are just a little more detailed than the rounded rectangles and other shapes that Figjam allows. When the project moves to that stage, I end up moving to regular Figma and using the comment functionality there, or, if it's difficult to manage access, create shapes in a Figma file then copy/paste into Figjam which can be tedious."," Users appreciate Figjam for its ability to organize ideas in an aesthetically pleasing way and facilitate collaboration with colleagues. They enjoy the customization tools and design features, but would like to see some Figma functions, such as saving an image, integrated into Figjam."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam lets me, my all-remote team, and our stakeholders quickly and easily collaborate to collect and organize ideas. It's incredibly simple and works well for people of all technical skillsets. I use it for hours every day.
User: FigJam is simple and flexible -- my team and I have used it for everything from workflow diagramming to stakeholder workshops on product vision. We've also trained non-designers to use the tool in under 2 minutes. They love it and even use it when we aren't around!
User: The ability to collaborate with non-authenticated users is incredible, but resetting the 24-hour timer is a bit tedious. I understand there has to be some inconvenience to push for more paid accounts, but I wish there was a way to extend those timers. I also wish there was a ""vertical alignment"" option in the menu bar for moving text to the top or bottom of shapes (in addition to horizontal alignment). But other than small feature requests like this, I have no complaints!","User praises Miro as a comprehensive collaboration tool that is intuitive and easy to use, with a valuable freemium version. However, they find the account and security hierarchy confusing at times."
figma,G2,"User: improves visibility and captures stakeholder feedback in a centralized location, provides the source of truth for designs, user flows and wireframes
User: Capturing feedback is super easy and contextual. Changing text content on Fig-jam is super easy without even opening Figma. I also love that I can use the Figma design system components on Fig-jam.
User: I will love that if you modify a Figma design that is on a Fig-jam board that design gets automatically updated on Fig-jam. currently I have to copy and paste manually","The user finds Miro helpful for understanding processes and collaborating with different teams, as it allows everyone to be on the same page. They also mention the need for the ability to import and export PowerPoint files, as well as creating their own version of PP for presentations."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam is where we host our virtual design sprints. It's solid for facilitating workshops and having all your notes in one place for later.
User: Enough diverse options for color schemes, fonts, etc so that everyone on the team can have a unique voice. Also love the auto-naming with sticky notes to keep track of everyone's contributions.
User: Some of the templates are pretty lame/ordinary. Also wish there was more robust voting capabilities.","Users find Figma helpful for organizing and engaging hybrid teams, tracking progress, and offering endless possibilities for various meeting types. However, sharing boards for editing and voting can be challenging, with room for improvement in the process."
figma,G2,"User: Helps to visually explain complex systems in a simple way. Provides value to our consultancy.
User: FigJam's simplicity and ease of use enables fast mapping and sharing of complex systems and dependencies. I've recently created several sprawling figjam charts that outline marketing programs from beginning to end for our clients. They have been so helpful keeping the team informed at a high level and are a great reference to regularly huddle around. 
 
This is just one kind of use - because of its flexibility you can begin to discover ways to think and present ideas large or small. Create fast design mock-ups, review and provide feedback on designs, create storyboards - the list can go on and on. Easily shareable to anyone with little to no trouble with login attempts or dealing with incompatible file types. 
 
It feels so freeing to break from the clunky confines of a ppt slide with its bad clip art and boring bullet points. Expanding across an endless canvas allows us to combat any confusion or anxiety that tends to show up around building complex marketing campaigns. 
 
Figjam has become one the most valuable tools in my arsenal and is one of the best I've seen after almost 2 decades of working with these types of apps. 
 
Highly recommended!
User: Can't think of any at the moment. I need to spend more time exploring all the templates to expand my usage.","Users find Figma easy to use for collaboration between design and development teams, and appreciate its features for creating design systems, libraries, and reusable projects. They suggest adding tutorials and help guidelines for further assistance."
figma,G2,"User: My coworkers don't work in the same office as me, so all our collaboration is done remotely. FigJam makes it easy to collaborate on brand strategies.
User: It's great for virtual whiteboard session. Our team uses it to brainstorm, take notes, and refine ideas both collaboratively and asynchronously.
User: It can take a minute to get the hang of it. If you move text around that has stickers or highlights on it, those elements don't move with the text.","Users appreciate Figma Jams for team collaboration, goal-setting, and creating user flows. However, they suggest improvements in object alignment, such as having a master object to align other objects around, similar to Illustrator."
figma,G2,"User: Collaborative space - it meeds our needs specifically for the design team to be able to share our work and thinking through diagrams and such.
User: It's easy to use and makes it easy for my team and I to host brainstorm sessions, syncs, literally anything and be able to share it easily and collaborate.
User: More dynamic stickies? Can't think of anything major to be fixed.","The user finds the product helpful for organizing their ideas and processes, appreciating the ease of navigation and the zoom-in and zoom-out features."
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration as visual workers is the main problem being solved. I think it benefits to be able to zoom in so closely to media and also zoom out/organize info in lots of ways for lots of people.
User: Really love being able to follow along with users and what they're looking at. I also think the comments feature is really useful for pinpointing specific regions on a project.
User: I would love drawovers to maybe be a bit more intuitively designed. Sometimes it's hard to draw on the media on the board and moving the drawover and media underneath can be tricky.","Users appreciate FigJam as a one-stop shop for collaboration, especially in remote-first environments. They use it for various purposes, including ideation, flow mapping, and user research planning. Users also value the ongoing updates that improve usability, performance, and speed, but suggest additional customization options, such as background colors and styles."
figma,G2,"User: I use basially all tools offered by the miro bc its applies to some or all of my work and since people are visual learners its easy to convey ideas or concepts.
User: The flexibility and the freedom conveying my thoughts with tools that are incredibly easy to use and present visual information about the idea I have or a concept i wanna explain
User: The loading time is pretty bad, everytime I open the micro the wait time in the middle of a meeting is too long for me. and if its a short meeting this loading time adds up","Users appreciate FigJam's Mindmapping and Whiteboard functionalities, which allowed them to replace Whimsical and Miro. They enjoy having an all-in-one tool and highlight its better performance compared to Miro. They hope Figma will continue to listen to customer feedback and make improvements accordingly."
figma,G2,"User: we are able to conduct workshops remotely and get even better results than we would have if we were in person on a whiteboard. It is also great to have all documentation in the same place.
User: Miro is a intuitive system that anyone can get up to speed and use within 5 min. It means that during a workshop you can get tangible outcomes early on. A workshop that previously took half a day, you can get the same result in 60min. Competing tools are somewhat on same level but I prefer the UI of Miro.
User: One downside is that since banking is a regulatory space, we are limited in how we can utilise the tool in terms of integration, not much to do with Miro but a general downside.","Users appreciate Figma's ability to facilitate remote collaboration and reduce meeting time. They find it superior to other whiteboards due to its speed, ease of use, and PDF output capabilities. However, some users find the admin functions complex and the cost high for large companies."
figma,G2,"User: It gives an easy to use platform for online meetings when we need to collaborate and use a whiteboard. it gives all stakeholders independent say and express their opinion safely.
User: Endless space where to collaborate and create the material. Compatibility with links and pictures. Creative space that takes the business stiffness out of equation.
User: Frustration of how many things there is to learn and how many things I might not know yet - how to best utilize. the grab and vector function sometimes doesn't respond to how I would like it :D And tool bar doesn't show what is what when hover over it","The user appreciates the versatility of Figma, allowing them to create designs and present them with comments, export them into a no code app, and create prototypes. They also appreciate the collaborative aspect and the ability to transfer comments between workspaces."
figma,G2,"User: It has provided a platform for us to collaborate and convey our ideas more creatively; from a productive perspective, it saves teams time as people can continually chime in and add to a board at any point during their day; we don't all have to be present or working on it together for it to work.
User: I like the group collaboration features; I think it is fantastic how everyone can get into working on an idea all at once; being a visual tool also helps; I think it's great.
User: If I were to mention something, it would be getting used to moving around the boards; it's a slightly different mindset; it's not a showstopper but a slight twist.","Users find Miro to be a collaborative and user-friendly tool with helpful templates and community support. However, they face challenges in locating work on the canvas due to varying zoom levels and placement by team members. They suggest marking the center of the canvas and starting at 100% zoom for consistency."
figma,G2,"User: Graphic design for a wide range of needs
User: I use Figma nearly every day for my graphic needs - I love that I don't have to have a ton of graphic skills to create and edit very polished designs. Furthermore, my graphic designers created some nice templates that are easy for me to update and re-use. It's easy to navigate and if I need to learn something new the docs are super useful.
User: It does take a little time to get onboarded but that's because it's a powerful tool with a lot of options for customization!","Users appreciate Figma for its ease of use, team collaboration, and visual work capabilities. They find Miro user-friendly and valuable for working with disbursed teams, offering various templates and features. However, some users would like additional features, such as image cutouts and easier access to Miroverse templates, and experience slow loading times with poor internet connections."
figma,G2,"User: To quickly visualize problems and ideas online. 
Collaboration for distributed teams. 
Better and more efficient workshops. 
More productive meetings.
User: Miro is like old fashioned whiteboards on steroids. Not only does Miro recreate the whiteboard experience in a digital space, it enhances the experience and makes it much better.
User: It lacks some functionality, like being able to hide sticky notes and highlight participants objects.","Users appreciate Miro for its comprehensive features that simplify remote collaboration, easy learning curve, and pre-built templates. However, some users find the complexity of its features challenging to learn initially, and note limitations in the free account compared to paid accounts."
figma,G2,"User: Figma is used for both our greyframes (medium-fidelity layout documents) as well as our final designs. It's collaboration tools are second to none and clients love getting the up-close look at their products. This really feels like a tool by web developers for web developers, though I will admit that the recent acquisition by Adobe makes me pretty nervous.
User: Figma is an excellent tool that forces a full paradigm shift for us designers. With auto-layout, objects on the page flow freely down the page, just like on the web. It's a 99% complete implementation of flexbox in a design program. Once you've gotten into the mindset shift of rows and columns (everything on a web page is just a nested collection of either rows or columns) you can use auto-layout to position everything on your page, and gone are the days of reflowing the entire comp because the length of the paragraph changed! (Looking at you, Photoshop).
User: The image manipulation tools are lacking. An image is either an object, which is fine, or a background. But there is no ability to set focal point on the backround, or borrow some of the CSS cover/constrain background positions.","Users find Figma helpful for remote collaboration, making their work more effective and efficient. They appreciate Miro's centralized file management, easy collaboration features, and numerous templates that provide structure to their research. Despite being slightly expensive, users believe it is worth the investment."
figma,G2,"User: It gives me a platform to share the team's current thinking with a wider audience. It's a virtual whiteboard where an outsider can come in and see everything that the team has been thinking about.
User: It's fast, snappy, and easy to setup. It's very easy to share with people who have never used FigJam before because they can open it inside the browser. It's simple that the features and onboarding are not overwhelming.
User: They used to have a generous free tier, but now there are more restrictions. There are also several shapes and formatting that you cannot do directly on FigJam.","The user appreciates Figma's online collaboration, documentation of unstructured discussions, and asynchronous collaboration. They found the onboarding process easy and liked the gradual introduction of helpful messages. However, they are unclear about the different user access levels for external participants and miss the Figma Section feature in Miro."
figma,G2,"User: It allows me to put all the pieces of my project in one place, so nothing gets lost. When you have an evolving project with research and numerous iterations it helps to be able to see all the info in one place and makes it easier for others to understand the full picture. 
 
I also use miro to share out work and do critiques. It is easy to have collaborators follow me on the board while I am presenting. I will generally share my screen while presenting, but it can be hard to see small details so having others in the board helps with this. There are comment and sticky notes available for peers to leave feedback too.
User: The board is endless and I can fill it with as much content as I want. There is a timer and you can set yourself to be followed around the board which makes critiques easier. It is extremely easy to add arrow connections. Overall, it's simple and easy to use.
User: Miro has cool features that are somewhat hidden so I didn't realize they existed for awhile. Because boards can fill up easily it helps to share a link for a frame directly and it can be done, but it's hidden behind a meatball menu. There are stickers, which come in handy, but are hidden behind a plus on the sidebar.","User loves Miro for its simplicity, ease of use, and self-explanatory shortcuts for brainstorming and sharing ideas. They appreciate the ability to sketch and create retro presentations, but find it difficult to zoom in and out and have multiple users on the same presentation spot."
figma,G2,"User: Miro has been able to provide a central dashboard for all of our teams to access and schedule location visits as needed.
User: The program has improved our ability to build boards to create transparency across all our teams.
User: Miro can at times be overwhelming until you get your boards organized and easy to access.","The user appreciates Figma's integration with Trainual, easy drag-and-drop functionality, and minimal formatting. However, they find the zooming feature a bit challenging compared to other platforms."
figma,G2,"User: Time wasted on file sharing. 
Creating a master file with all pieces of collaboration. 
Better tracking of new ideas. 
More comprehensive strategy development. 
Better setup for collaboration.
User: It is an easy way to collaborate on projects with multiple people located at multiple places. 
There is no need to spend time to gather ideas and start developing them.
User: Settings that are not easy to find, like moving around sometimes is set with right click, other times click and drag.","The user appreciates the simplicity of the platform and its ability to visually explain complicated concepts, while also mentioning its differences from other design platforms, which can be confusing at times."
figma,G2,"User: I use it for several things: private documents to guide my thinking and notes; collaborative whiteboards; sharing diagrams with colleagues; and documentation.
User: As far as I'm aware, Miro is unique in its ability to enable a user to rapidly build diagrams in real-time while other users observe or contribute simultaneously. I can create flow charts and diagrams so quickly. And it's easy to make the results look great.
User: The tables feature is lackluster, but it's still an experiment. Other than that, the licensing model has been slightly annoying to deal with. If I want a colleague to contribute to a board, they need a full license, even if they use it for 30 minutes and never use it again. This arrangement doesn't feel optimal from a fairness and value point-of-view, but I still find the tool to be worth the money.","The user finds Figma helpful for designing and creating diagrams, making requirements easily understandable for developers and testers. However, they face an issue with different UI versions getting minimized and reflecting other versions when maximized."
figma,G2,"User: We're a hybrid company and working in Product, we often need to have collaborative sessions across teams where some members are remote and some are in person. This is by far the best replacement for old-fashioned in-person whiteboarding with sticky notes, and it's even better because you can save it and easily access it later.
User: It's been conducive to facilitating collaboration on designs, whiteboarding, brainstorming, process reviews, and strategy sessions. Figjam's design makes it easy to use for a wide variety of scenarios. We've used it asynchronously to prep for a discussion as well as simultaneously in-meeting as a way to accomplish in-person whiteboarding-type conversations, especially when some participants are remote.
User: The UI took a little getting used to, and there was a short learning curve to figure out how to access different elements and add them to the page.","Users appreciate Miro's remote collaboration capabilities, allowing colleagues to access and work on the board simultaneously, improving productivity and meeting deadlines. However, they find the default templates and sticky notes to be too small."
figma,G2,"User: How might we collaborate efficiently in a hybrid work environment? 
 
Workshopping within miro means people can participate in workshops remotely, regardless of where they are in the planet. This has also meant that travelling for workshops has become less important - saving the business money.
User: Obviously the pandemic force a lot of us to find new ways to collaborate and connect without being face to face. Miro was clearly ahead of the game in this regard. But even since we're seeing more of each other in the flesh, miro still seems to be adding value with how easy it ease to document workshops, quickly capture ideas, and bring people together to brainstorm.
User: There are very few things to dislike about miro. There are some very minor things like how tables not being incredibly user-friendly, limitations in how you can modify shapes (particularly for the sake of creating wireframes). But all in all, this stuff is nice to have and the fact that you can even do basic wire framing along side everything else that you can do is a win.","Users appreciate Miro's ability to align remote meeting participants and create engaging, self-documenting workshops. The speed and fluidity of the application enhance the facilitator experience. However, the licensing model and board structure can be confusing for infrequent collaborators, and users suggest improving security by including the entire enterprise as users and charging only for power users."
figma,G2,"User: Figjam helps me with designing website wireframes the most. I like using mindmaps to get everything organized in a presentable manner! The whole design process is more enjoyable thabks to figjam!
User: Figjam/figma is the best design wireframe/ux site on the internet! I've been using figma for years now. I couldn't be happier with the value they provide! I personally think figma & Canva are much better than Adobe!
User: The only downside to using figjam is it's only accessable from a desktop. I hope one day I'll be able to use it on mobile. Other than that, I have no complaints!","Users appreciate Figma for its creative thinking, collaboration, flexibility, and board templates, making it easy to learn and use. However, they mention a limit on boards and a slight learning curve as minor drawbacks."
figma,G2,"User: We have a large team, so having a unified collaborative space to put our thoughts down helps keep us organised.
User: The ability to organise multiple projects and tasks in a single workspace.
User: I'd love to see some AI integration to help you figure out the right templates for your objectives (there are so many to choose from!)","The user finds Figjam helpful for collaboration during presentations and appreciates the available widgets/plugins, especially the photobooth feature. They also value the connection with Figma. However, they face issues when copying and pasting designs from Figma, resulting in using screenshots, and would like the ability to lock information during voting sessions."
figma,G2,"User: Above all Miro is assisting me in visually communicating areas of inefficiencies to my internal clients. Showing them through visually exciting means, when things are working and when they are not.
User: The flexibility and functionality is unmatched! The ability to build pretty much anything, in any way is what I love the most about Miro. As well as the collaboration.
User: There isint much that I dont love about Miro, however I will say that the more frustrating part is the copying graphics correctly from one Miro board to the next, this could be a user problem, but it doesnt always copy 1:1.","Users appreciate FigJam as a whiteboard tool integrated within Figma, which allows them to quickly create visual concepts. However, they suggest improvements such as more formatting options for post-its, the ability to show and hide sections for specific users or groups, and additional features to facilitate group collaboration during workshops."
figma,G2,"User: We have used other platforms in the past with similar capabilities, but FigJam is very easy to use. It helps us diagram out our workflows and processes, but internally and externally for clients. The important thing is that someone outside of our organization (that doesn't use FigJam every day) can easily use it and collaborate.
User: Being able to collaborate with both internal and external stakeholders is very easy. The UI makes it easy to create and ideate our processes and sharing the FigJam with others is seamless. They don't need to download anything to hop in and start editing.
User: There isn't much I would say I dislike about FigJam. There are some limitations in choices when building out flows, such as shapes or colors, but it hasn't effected me from being able to create what I need.","The user Miro's reusable frameworks and coverage of functional areas for client pitches, but does not have any specific drawbacks to mention as they also love using Miro"
figma,G2,"User: collating many screenshots and adding notes. Very useful for combining screenshots with diagrams, text and offering more collaboration between viewers. Fairly simple to pick up and use, which is great. It would be nice to have a start screen for a project to help the casual user.
User: I use Miro for my individual work projects, and to collaborate with teams. For my own work, Miro is great for collating screenshots, creating diagrams and adding notes / commentaries. The infinite canvas is great for just gettng started and getting ideas out. For a team, it's very good for creating lightweight tables and timelines. There are good tools for collaboration.
User: I use Miro to collate and to share when I'm 'driving' the presentation. It's less good for linear presentation. You can create an ordering of canvases, but I get worried about leaving a recipient of my link to Miro to find the first board and then go into presentation mode. It would be nice to have a link to share that handles that, so it's easy to open and view linearly before getting to the full canvas view.","Users appreciate Figma's ability to visualize app designs on mobile screens before implementation, as it helps understand the UI/UX. They find it easy to use and detailed, giving a realistic feel of the app. However, they suggest adding a feature to see screen transitions and how the app reacts when CTAs are clicked."
figma,G2,"User: Majority of people is visual-dominant, including me - so there's much easier to show, than tell about the ideas, solutions, etc. It's great canvas for product planning, project planning, etc.
User: I love 'there's an app for that' approach I can have loooking for Miro templates - almost whatever I can think of - it's already there. Ready to use System Thinking step-by-step template? Here it is. Multiple Retrospective ideas - here you go. Maybe simple kanban implementation? At your service.
User: Sometimes performance drops, especially on heavy-in-pictures boards. I'd go for a feature, hinting best settings for the graphics, etc. not to spoil the performance.","User finds Figma extremely useful for UX/UI design collaboration, making the process easy and effective, with no dislikes mentioned."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is solving many problems. Giving me a place to collaborate with others in a hybrid environment along with providing all the templates for a variety of work in one place allows me to use the tool to its fullest potential.
User: I like the dynamic templates for a variety of projects, screen sizing, ability to collaborate with peers in person or virtually, along with the ease of personalization.
User: There aren't too many downsides or dislikes that I've found. Perhaps the most annoying thing is the struggles that come from people working on the same page, but overall that can be mitigated by locking items so they don't get changed.","User appreciates FigJam for its ease of creating diagrams and flowcharts, especially for communicating technical systems. They wish it had a feature to create multiple wire attachment points on one side of a shape, using a snap-to-grid alignment."
figma,G2,"User: It is great for collaboration and makes remote working much easier as often it can be difficult to collaborate with colleagues when working from home or hosting online sessions
User: I really like Miro- it makes it very easy to share the progress of a research project in a novel way. Also really useful to share the findings and used as a collaboration tool in group sessions
User: I sometimes struggle navigating and moving things around the board such as the post it notes and sometimes find random arrows being drawn when I haven't intended to add them.","Users appreciate FigJam's ease of use and seamless integration with Figma, making it a highly collaborative tool. However, they find it expensive and wish it was included in a standard Figma subscription."
figma,G2,"User: Getting good results out of vIrtual working
User: Helped durng lockdown in particular to allow collaboration work to continue at pace.
User: Initially had some challenges with latency when a lot of people were using. Also people deleting things accidentally but upgrades seem to have improved it.","User appreciates the flexibility and versatility of FigJam, as it allows them to collaborate with their team in a variety of different ways, from whiteboarding to retrospectives to planning meetings. They appreciate the freedom to structure the content as they see fit."
figma,G2,"User: Planning for events; 
Workshopping solutions to business process improvements 
Visual timelines for project and programmes
User: Easy to use - easy to explain the basics to a new user. Great shapes and colours which allows a group to explore and share ideas for a variety of purposes
User: As an individual, it would be great to have some tutorials - but I can see some great examples of work that support making use of Miro in new ways for our small public sector organisation.","The user finds the tool useful for remote companies and early-stage companies without design experience, but feels it consumes too much RAM space and some features are not as exhaustive as MIRO."
figma,G2,"User: Sharing our work with the team is easy with MIRO, and some features contribute to an excellent experience, like the voting session. 
MIRO also proposes interesting templates to make multiple of things
User: - All the different possibilities Miro offers: Visual Board, Agile management, Brainstorming, Mind map... 
- The different features added last year, voting, timer...etc 
Miro helps us every day with the management of the team.
User: Creating a UML diagram is probably not a very good experience if we compare it to other tools. It's not easy enough with the features proposed, like to auto resizing or the link between different boxes","Users appreciate FigJam for its easy-to-use whiteboarding tool that enables better visual communication and collaboration among teams. However, some users find the UI complicated, particularly those unfamiliar with Figma's infinite canvas system."
figma,G2,"User: Online workshop enviroment, that allows for quick workshop and ideation to full fletched service blueprints. Where we first used several tools we now all do it in Miro.
User: Miro works very intuitive and it is very easy to collaborate with colleagues and people inside the company, the embedded teams feature is a great addition.
User: Sometimes the application tends to get slow and starts lagging, this can be sometimes a bit annoying, especially with big boaards.","User praises Figma as a great platform for UX design, particularly appreciating the component creation and design system features. However, they find the folder organization challenging and difficult to navigate."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam impose a collaborative and creative environment. 
It allows teams to work together visually. 
The interactive nature of the tool encourages active participation, engagement, and co-creation. It promotes the sharing of diverse perspectives, sparking creativity and innovation within teams.
User: It offers a range of features like sticky notes, shapes, freehand drawing, etc. 
FigJam is versatile for different types of projects and teams, as it also provides various templates and customisable options.
User: FigJam works great with Figma, but when you need to integrate it with other design tools rather than Figma, it is not easy and more of a manual task. 
It gets really hard to cooperate when using different design tools than Figma.","User appreciates the flexibility and endless canvas for organizing ideas with colleagues, but finds images to be slow and low-res, and struggles to keep organized between multiple boards."
figma,G2,"User: Another problem that Miro solves is the challenge of sharing complex ideas in a simple way. Miro's range of templates, diagrams, and sticky notes make it easy to share ideas visually, which can be especially helpful for projects that require a lot of detail or complexity. This has allowed me to communicate my ideas more effectively with my team members, resulting in better collaboration and a more efficient workflow.
User: I have found Miro to be an incredibly powerful tool for collaborating with teams. One of the things I like best about Miro is how easy it is to use. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it simple to get started even for those who are not particularly tech-savvy. 
The real-time collaboration features in Miro are also incredibly helpful. Multiple team members can work on a board simultaneously, which helps to streamline the collaborative process and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features, such as templates, sticky notes, and diagrams, are highly customizable, allowing for greater flexibility when working on projects.
User: One thing that I have found to be a drawback of Miro is its pricing structure. While the platform offers a free plan, its more advanced features are only available with paid plans, which may be expensive for smaller teams or individuals. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users, and it may take some time to learn how to use everything effectively. However, Miro's support resources, including video tutorials and a user community, are quite helpful in getting up to speed quickly.",The user loves FigJam for its ease of use and prefers it over multiple apps for conceptualizing ideas and storyboards. They have not used any other whiteboarding app and cannot identify any limitations.
figma,G2,"User: Easier collaboration for remote teams. Having oversight on work and documenting in a single location - helps with visibility and engagement amongst team members.
User: Awesome oversight for projects as a whole, to plan, document, workshop, etc. Probably best tool for virtual workshops. 
 
Generally pretty intuitive to use, especially for new users. Also like that it's evolving to integrate other apps and more features.
User: Unable to make visuals and diagrams interactive. 
 
Sometimes fatigue is moving across the board and zooming in and out - unsure if I create things at the right scale. Also an issue for new users is zooming, moving across the board. 
 
Tables can be clunky, I like using simple tables to track information cause it's quick and easy for organizing info. 
 
Not very good at copying and pasting elements from other sources (eg. ppt tables) into Miro. 
 
I wish I could consolidate my personal and work account so I don't have to log in and out.","Users appreciate Figma's ease of use, prototyping capabilities, and collaboration features, along with helpful tutorials for plugins. However, they suggest adding a built-in flattening tool for exporting files as PDFs to improve the experience."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam is a valuable tool for my team and me. It allows us to efficiently produce low-fidelity wireframes, develop visual designs, and engage in collaborative ideation on a shared canvas.
User: FigJam makes it easy for multiple users to work together on the same canvas in real time, regardless of location. This helps the team conduct brainstorming sessions and ideate together for their tasks. 
Its intuitive interface helps easily create diagrams, flowcharts, mind maps and other required diagrams. 
Also, figmJam provide the integration facility with other Figma products and third-party applications like slack.
User: There is nothing to dislike in FigJam but something that I find odd FigJam is cursor chat feature.","User finds Figma easy to use, collaborative, and enjoyable, with good graphic integrations. They suggest adding more graph options for visual data analysis to improve the product further."
figma,G2,"User: we have a common platform to visualize, add input collectively and collaborate easily. 
 
I used to draw pictures to add in my daily presentation which makes it understandable to everyone in meetings.
User: We can set whole Agile events like refinement meetings, planning, mood board, and retrospective meetings organized and visualized on Miro. 
 
We are making drawings, visualizing and teaching each other to grow together.
User: As per my experience, writing with a pen is not smooth; Miro can propose some pen and touchpad so we can write like pen and paper. That will save time and struggle while making drawings."," The user appreciates FigJam for its comprehensive tools and features that make UI/UX design faster and easier, as well as the flexibility to share designs with clients. However, they find the enterprise plan to be overpriced despite its impressive features."
figma,G2,"User: As mentioned in the advantages as well, Figjam helps us to prepare beautiful decks and presentations without affecting any pixel quality so we can send the the decks to our clients.
User: The best thing about FigJam is that in our industry, we had to prepare a lot of presentations for the clients related to our products such as video player, but it has helped us to prepare a lot of decks for our products in which the quality and pixels remain intact so that the quality doesn't get compromised.
User: The only thing that I don't like about Figjam is the complicated use of it, like I am not much into the designing part and couldn't learn figjam at once, so we had to take a person who's aware about figjam and they can use it.","Users find Figma helpful for creating new designs and collaborating on design projects with their team, as well as commenting and reporting on others' work. They consider it one of the best tools for creating wireframes."
figma,G2,"User: Miro solves two huge problems for me. 
 
1. Remote working and having collaborative sessions with other team members. Before I found Miro, having these sessions was incredibly hard 
2. When you write on a whiteboard, at some stage it gets rubbed off. Miro you can have endless whiteboards that you never need to delete
User: Miro is incredibly helpful for a number of reasons. The best way to look at it is like a whiteboard with all the relevant tools, online. You can use it for brainstorming sessions, mapping customer journeys, comparing notes and heaps more. It feels like I have only just scraped the surface with what is possible on Miro.
User: Honestly, there aren't many downsides to using Miro. The hardest part is probably getting use to it and understanding what you should use for certain things. Maybe some more tutorials would be helpful.","The user finds Figma helpful for design creation, review, and QA purposes, appreciating its easy-to-understand UI and simple commenting system. However, they find sharing content challenging, as it requires sharing the entire board, leading to confusion and difficulty in accessing specific content."
figma,G2,"User: n/a
User: relatively user-friendly, not too steep of a learning curve 
ability to visually show ideas, thought processes - all types of mapping tools
User: not great for aligning formats to create visually appealing or structured pictures and graphs...needs manual adjustments,","The user prefers the quarterly planning method for remote collaboration, appreciating the ability to brainstorm with team members across the globe and the lack of features in the free version."
figma,G2,"User: Online collaboration platform that provides a whiteboarding type experience. This was crucial during the covid era lockdowns and allowed us to effectively run our workshops
User: Ability to run multiple collaboration initiatives including but not limited to various types of brainstorming activities, product designs, wireframes. I have tried other whiteboarding tools from Microsoft and Google but they lack templates and experience that Miro provides
User: 1. I would like to see a more mature library of templates around wireframes. 2. Licensing cost. Especially in the era of super low-cost collaboration tools from large platforms like Microsoft.","Users find Figjam to be an effective collaboration tool for remote teams, enabling brainstorming and project planning in a single, consolidated space. It has successfully replaced in-person whiteboard sessions and is highly appreciated by users, with very few dislikes."
figma,G2,"User: Miro has the power to aggregate what has been shared among multiple tools. In addition, it has the potential to allow multiple people to work at the same time without any problems, and it has been used in seminars and training sessions, and has been very popular. In the training that I participate in, training using miro is increasing, and it is very useful to visualize the result of the discussion in a short time.
User: Miro is easier to use than an actual whiteboard. In particular, it's easy to attach, write, move, and connect sticky notes, and it automatically corrects the connection lines, so you can use it more efficiently than an actual whiteboard. So you can focus on the discussion. Also, miro is great for sharing information you create online, ensuring that the same image information is conveyed. As a comparison to other similar tools, it's nice to have reaction features, icons, and formatting that you can't use up.
User: The disadvantage of miro is that the access can be quite slow depending on the board. When you first open a board with a lot of information on it, you often have to wait a few 10 seconds. I hope that this problem will be solved by devising means such as image processing centered on the area where the display priority is being determined. Also, if you just use it, you don't have a chance to see new or useful functions, so I think it would be good if you were shown it by a pop-up (This feature may already exist and you may have turned it off yourself, but it is true that it does not appear at this time.).","The user appreciates Figma for its ease of use in remote and hybrid teams, allowing for asynchronous problem-solving and accessible designs. However, they find the flow charting feature challenging when referencing other boards."
figma,G2,"User: Quickly producing quality visual representations that professionally and accurately reflect complex concepts / collaborations / solutions.
User: If you want to communicate a process, or concept, Miro is an amazing tool with extensive starting templates and tools to customise as required.
User: The version control and rollback options could be better to avoid committing unwanted changes.","Users find FigJam to be a powerful collaboration tool with a wide range of features, making it ideal for interactive lessons and activities. However, some users feel overwhelmed by the numerous features and find it challenging to navigate, especially with multiple users working simultaneously."
figma,G2,"User: It's helping us build wireframes for communications and allows larger group of stakeholders to provide comments or answer questions for the creator.
User: I like that you're not restricted to the size of a Word doc or power point slide and that I can fit everything I need to share on one page.
User: I can't export a wireframe to PDF. I have to take a screen shot instead. Would be great to be able to share it as a still image or like a slide deck.","Users appreciate Figma for its ability to facilitate dynamic webinar activities, team organization, and group management. They find it encourages creativity, is comfortable, intuitive, and easy to understand. The tool offers many possibilities and is considered innovative. No negative aspects were mentioned."
figma,G2,"User: Live updates, so you can see and monitor changes as they occur.
User: It's free to use and also very enjoyable!
User: It requires a very stable internet connection.","Users appreciate FigJam for its ability to facilitate remote collaboration, making it feel like everyone is in the same room. They have used it for various purposes, such as creating diagrams, mind maps, calendar schedules, retros, and even wedding planning. However, some users find the templates daunting and not always meeting their exact needs, leading them to search for alternatives or create their own layouts."
figma,G2,"User: Being able to have a lot of info in one place. Being able to reduce paper waste.
User: Easily being able to just dump a lot of information! From there I am able to sort through and make sense of info and create meaningful work out of it.
User: It can become a little glitchy from time to time, especially when there is a lot of data on a board.",User praises FigJam for its ability to facilitate team collaboration and hosting a meme competition in their organization. They appreciate the user experience and ease of design and collaboration within the platform.
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration on process changes and improvements. Mapping out the current processes and brainstorming any tweaks and changes. Has also helped in prioritisation planning
User: It is the culmination of tools that make my work life easier. Other tools that I have tried to use to aid in collaboration have fallen short or were overly complicated to set up or share. Miro has that ease of use coupled with advanced features if required.
User: The only thing I can think of is having extra snap points on a shape. I find the thing that I spend the most time on is trying to align shapes and connections lines. so having some additional points so that they all align nicely would be amazing.","The user finds the product intuitive and easy to use for remote team collaboration, but mentions that it can be difficult to see things on the page due to its wide width. They suggest a big monitor for better visibility."
figma,G2,"User: Mainly Miro help to explain complex process put in symple , so many stakeholders , many steps are understaind in a straighfoward way; Also another propuse is the flowcharts written in MIRO are the bases to easy-understaind standard operational process that they are transfers for many hands a long the time
User: The colaborating way to let ones interative in the same time and the wide options of find any kind of template . The cronometers option is helpful to optimize the time of my meeting as a project manager.
User: the latetancy of internet does not help to enjoy the advantage to MIRO , so maybe if the developer of this amazing tool can think in a destop app or a way the work offline after load can offset that necesity","The user found Figma's team structure creation simple and efficient, taking less than 5 minutes with no training. They suggest incorporating AI to provide improvement suggestions for their FigJam layout."
figma,G2,"User: The pre-built templates help a lot when creating visual flows. This gives me a visual way to explain processes to my team and others.
User: The flexibility it provides. Multiple users who can work on the same board and the ability to update info in real time is extremely useful.
User: There is a bit of a learning curve to start using it. It's hard to expect users who are unfamiliar with Miro to be able to easily navigate around a board."," Users appreciate Miro's simplicity and ease of use for communication between designers and non-designers, as well as its range of templates. However, they find organizing boards challenging and suggest implementing a folder system and pages within boards, similar to Figma, for better organization."
figma,G2,"User: It's simple to share my ideas in a graphical form, I can get into deep on my proposals and concepts using this tool. Which translates in being more effective in communicating and sharing my work with others.
User: The interface, it's so easy and intuitive that creating and sharing your thoughts is very simple to do. I think it is a powerful tool to use during several moments on creative processes.
User: Sometimes I think that I am underusing it. I haven't had the time to explore all the features available. Maybe it would be easier for me if there were a step-by-step of new features.","Users find Figma helpful for running workshops and organizing information visually, with easy onboarding for clients and various collaborative features like voting, reactions, and timers. However, sharing boards can be tricky due to potential extra charges, and the selection between reactions and vote tools is unclear."
figma,G2,"User: being able to share collections across all cross functional teams!
User: being able to have quality images in one place to see my assortment and be used my multiple people at once
User: can be hard to navigate around the boards. takes a while to load if there is a large board","Users find Figma helpful for remote team collaboration and brainstorming, making it more accessible and efficient for designers. They appreciate the real-time collaboration, pre-made templates, and design components. However, they feel it has limited brainstorming options compared to competitors, and the interface is amateur and clunky. Additionally, real-time collaboration can be slow or laggy."
figma,G2,"User: Collaborative work, time saving with comprehensive templates, easy to create good looking charts and flows without design hassle.
User: We use Miro for different verticals in our agency from information architecture creation to user experience workshops to process design. It has an amazing user interface, easy to learn, adapt and use for all level of users both for clients and colleagues.
User: Time to time when you use Chrome browser, you can have some level of performance issues on low level devices for large boards. It's rather a system issue then Miro issue but, performance optimization can be an agenda.","The user appreciates Figjam for enabling their fully distributed team to work on problems and create in real time together, with multiple people collaborating easily and quickly. They find it accessible even for those unfamiliar with design products. However, they suggest having more preset options to start from, although they acknowledge the large community."
figma,G2,"User: I use Miro to visualize the project as a whole. This helps me to carry out mind maps and search for better solutions. In addition to the best visualization of my project as a whole and which path to follow.
User: Miro is excellent when it comes to a good visualization of a project or situation, which directly helps in the search for a solution and conclusion of visions and problems. Or even projects as a whole.
User: The Miro can be easily overloaded when we place too many elements on the screen, loading slows down, and this frustrates the user experience a bit.","The user appreciates FigJam for making it easy to create engaging social media posts and reach potential customers, as well as for providing creative designs for novice designers. They find it unfair that novice designers can access such creative designs through the community."
figma,G2,"User: Solves all my problems around creating anchor/tangible artifacts to ideas and the discussions that come from those ideas.
User: That I can have all my work displayed in front of me and I can prepare for meeting ahead of time with what I will present for working sessions.
User: Still struggle to integrate virtual whiteboards with physical meetings.","Users appreciate FigJam for enabling team collaboration and brainstorming through its whiteboard feature, making group meetings simpler. They find it a helpful tool with no significant drawbacks."
figma,G2,"User: Our organization is working on many new priorities, and Miro is helping to organize those initiatives across our team. Including Miro has allowed our team to see everything we are working on and all aspects of each priority.
User: Miro is a very robust place for brainstorming. You can Create teams with access to specific boards and make a board available for everyone. There are a lot of templates to help gather your thoughts efficiently and productively. However, my favorite aspect about Miro is the ability to collaborate.
User: The only thing I dislike about Miro is the ability to collaborate outside your team. You can only share a board with those entered as team members, which you must pay for. I would appreciate the ability to add outside folks to different boards.","User finds Figma helpful for website design and appreciates its ease of use compared to Miro, with only a short learning curve required."
figma,G2,"User: Allowing remote teams to collaborate on ideas, strategies, roadmaps etc.
User: Ease of collaboration across virtual teams
User: It's not immediately intuitive. When there are new users brought into a meeting utilizing Miro they can't immediately jump in. Requires some ramp up/training before being able to jump in","The user finds Figma helpful for team collaboration, brainstorming ideas, and flowcharts, especially for product managers."
figma,G2,"User: It can be very difficult to brainstorm or mind map effectively with a virtual team, it can be difficult to centralize data and draw connections for complex problems, and it can be hard to create clear visual indicators for project management. Miro makes all of these things easier and more effective.
User: The flexibility - allows me to use it for nearly everything from brainstorming to project coordination. Can move items anywhere, use different shapes/sizes/colors, add labels, show dependencies, zoom in and out, the list goes on.
User: Minor features - I'd like to be able to add labels to any object (not just stickies), and tables can be cumbersome to work with.","Users appreciate Figma's ease of setup, collaboration features, and seamless integration with FigJam, making it ideal for design and marketing teams. However, it lacks the option for quick workshops and free licenses like Miro."
figma,G2,"User: Faciliating and documenting collaboration across my team
User: Miro is extremely helpful for facilitating conversations during remote settings.
User: I find the tool a little difficult to use. As mentioned, it's best when used for real-time collaboration especially in remote settings.",Users find Figma valuable for visual collaboration but face challenges in understanding the flow if not used properly. They appreciate the open document method but would like a default option to spark ideas.
figma,G2,"User: Linking together a magnitude of information generally scattered throughout multiple sites in my company's intranet. Miro also allows a space for my team to refer back to as a single source of information.
User: One of the better whiteboard tools that is easy to navigate and use. I enjoy the table features and sticky notes. Also the ability to use embedded comments on anything on the board.
User: When updating the table functions the back button will erase all items entered in the table and not just the last thing added. It makes it challenging to edit things added without losing all the changes made.","User praises the collaboration, comments, and grouping features for improving decision-making capabilities and real-time collaboration. They appreciate the tool's ability to add comments and reactions to sticky notes, flowcharts, mind maps, and wireframes."
figma,G2,"User: It has made virtual events much more interesting and interactive for our participants, and has made working remotely easier (people can draw connections, group items, etc. like on a flip chart, white board, or with post-its but don't need to be in the same room together).
User: It's flexible - you can really do almost anything you want with it, it's not too hard to learn, and it makes working remotely and hosting virtual events much easier and more engaging.
User: It can make less tech-savvy people feel a bit isolated or left behind in meetings. It might be nice to have a very simple/obvious chat option in Miro where folks can suggest additions if they struggle to add a post-it (which happens).","Users find FigJam versatile and useful for small teams with different roles, such as design, development, and content. However, it may be challenging for non-designers to learn."
figma,G2,"User: No need to prepare power point presentations. Reduced my meeting durations.
User: Interactive as well as helpful for presentation. Very user-friendly for white-boarding and team collaboration.
User: Sometimes difficult to navigate if there is lot of content and spread across multiple frames"," Users appreciate FigJam for real-time collaboration on website outlines and wireframing ideas, but mention a slight learning curve."
figma,G2,"User: Miro helps us have one place for designs, significant milestones, and team collaboration. It enables work globally and a quicker location to go back and find previous decisions and collaborations.
User: Visual data sharing! It is a great place to put pictures and ideas and map processes. It is like having a visual management board in the traditional ""war room"" but digital so anyone can access it, and it is saved. Being able to use templates is also huge for getting teams started
User: It does not integrate well with some apps or display items. Tables are still not ideal, and it is often better to work in excel and copy-paste your data into Miro. Scaling can also be a little clunky, where it can be harder to keep things visible at a high enough level but also readable when sharing sections. 
 
The menus and controls are also not super intuitive. It definitely takes time to bring new members up to speed.","The user loves Figma for its ease of use and plugins for UI design, as it helps them develop software and websites. They appreciate the software's ability to create UI designs for iOS and Android Apps, but wish it had Photoshop-like options for creating things."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is helping us work virtually and collaborate in a shared space in a flexible manner. We are able to collaborate on mapping existing processes, dynamic thought mapping by categories, and a general shared space to easily collect thoughts and move them around quickly as the discussion evolves.
User: Miro is excellent for virtual whiteboarding and an excellent live collaboration tool for teams to utilize for a multitude of planning and brainstorming activities.
User: The downsides I've experienced with Miro is that it can be difficult to organize the boards you've contributed to or are actively participating in vs ones that you've previously contributed to and to separate them by categories. I haven't found a good way to categorize boards and so they all kind of land on my favorites or recent boards list and that's it, then I just have the board names to use to find what I'm looking for.","Users appreciate Figjam for its collaborative features, such as the ability to hop on a call and brainstorm with music, as well as the prebuilt templates and sticker elements for creative exercises. However, they find it slightly finicky when resizing fonts and desire more design flexibility similar to Figma's full functions."
figma,G2,"User: I like using MIro to manage projects, brainstorm, collaborate, visualize data and processes, and it's a great tool for facilitating any conversation and workshop because it encourages active participation.
User: Miro is great for instant and seamless collaboration and has a ton of great features, including sticky notes that you can color-code, pre-filled-out templates to accomplish whatever you need, and a nice, clean, user-friendly interface.
User: The only downside I can see is that it could be technically daunting to some people to learn new software. However, after using it in workshops and encouraging people to explore, they usually come around to it. I also wish that the free version had more free boards to create instead of being limited to 3.","Users appreciate Figma's ability to solve space limitations and accommodate large amounts of information, as well as its real-time collaboration features, making it ideal for remote teams. Figjam offers various elements like charts, diagrams, and visual aids. However, some users find it challenging to learn and wish for more customization options and a mobile app."
figma,G2,"User: Figma helps us maximize our small team and bandwidth by allowing us to design and work asynchronously. We can create and iterate quickly, ultimately delivering better product experiences and marketing initiatives faster -- which is critical for a startup.
User: Figma is most helpful for getting everyone on the team quickly with a visual realization of a campaign, creative asset or even clickable prototype for sales pitches. Organization is logical; comment and approval notifications get attention and are simple to use; overall intuitive platform.
User: It would be nice to see different help articles and tools based on user sophistication and comfort level with the product.","The user appreciates Miro's versatility, comparing it to a whiteboard that is easy for everyone to use, with features like screenshots repositories, markups, user flows, and progress boards. However, they find organizing boards within their organization challenging, often losing track of specific Miro boards"
figma,G2,"User: Applying the in-person whiteboarding experience to a virtual environment when meeting in-person is not an option.
User: Collaboration function that serves as a virtual whiteboard. I also like all of the different templates that help organize and structure the content.
User: Some of the user experiences are not the easiest to use (e.g., applying consistent fonts or moving things around on the board)","Users appreciate FigJam for its speed in creating new designs and its effective collaboration features. However, some users find it challenging to connect boxes when creating flowcharts, although improvements have been made in each version."
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration. We use it extensively during PI planning. Very easy to use
User: Very slick tool. We've been using it for PI planning since the beginning of Pandemic. Now I started using it as a replacement of PowerPoint
User: Sometimes hard to find the boards I want","Users appreciate Figma's Figjam for its ability to create flowcharts, collaborate with teams, and easily attach images for wireframing. They find the UI and ease of use impressive, but suggest improving the UX for attaching arrows to individual boxes."
figma,G2,"User: Dynamic collaboration. Saves hours on going back and forth on things
User: I am a SW engineer, and working simultaneously with your team on designing and architecting code involves a lot of diagramming. Rather than having one person do all the changes, Miro allows live and dynamic updates as the discussions are held
User: My biggest gripe with Miro is the inability to auto arrange my post-its in an evenly spaced manner. That feature works poorly and brings tears to my eyes. When my post its are inside a box, there should be an option to space it out in the box","Users appreciate Miro's visual and collaborative features, which help teams see the bigger picture and understand strategies better than other tools like MS Whiteboard and Excel. However, they suggest offering a less expensive licensing option for businesses that don't require advanced features, as some team members only use basic functions like stickies and emojis"
figma,G2,"User: Making everything visual and allowing connection points helps team members see the larger picture. Having the ability to create high-level roadmaps helps to understand the strategy. Other tech options (MS Whiteboard, Excel, etc.) are available today but are not nearly as effective.
User: I truly enjoy the collaborative nature of Miro. The fact that everyone on my team can hop on and add content is super helpful. It allows me to understand better where people are coming from and lets me draw (literally) correlations between ideas.
User: One downside of using Miro is the licensing aspect. It would be great if there were a way to have a less expensive licensed option for business that doesn't allow for all of the bells and whistles. Many team members, for example, will stick to creating stickies and emojis and never use any templates or more advanced features.","Users appreciate Miro's dynamic collaboration feature, which saves time by allowing simultaneous work on design and architecture. However, they express frustration with the inability to auto-arrange post-its evenly, especially within a box, and suggest improving this feature"
figma,G2,"User: How to diagram a system so a group of people can look at it and analyze it.
User: It's truly like a whiteboard. You can do anything in it and it's easy for everyone to use. Screenshots repositories with mark ups, user flows, progress boards. All super easy in Miro
User: Organizing boards within our organization has been kind of tricky. Probably mostly our own fault but does seem like 'where did that one Miro board go' does happen fairly often","Users find Figma to be an easy-to-use and slick tool for collaboration during PI planning, with some even using it as a PowerPoint replacement. However, they sometimes face difficulty in finding the desired boards."
figma,G2,"User: 1) It solves the problem of limited in terms of space, making difficult to accomodation large amount of info 
2) It allows multiple users to collaborate in real time 
3) provide range of different elements like charts, diagram visual aids etc
User: Figjam is collaborative features. Its allows multiple users to collaborate in real time making it an excellent tool for remote teams working together. 
Many elements like visual elements, sticky notes, creatives brainstorming, import images etc.
User: 1) Limited options on elements to customize it. 
2) Challenge to learn it. 
3) No mobile app","Users appreciate Figma's virtual whiteboarding experience and collaboration features, along with its variety of templates. However, they find some user experiences, such as applying consistent fonts and moving elements on the board, challenging to use."
figma,G2,"User: We use FigJam to build website outlines and it is so nice to all be looking at the same thing at the same time and in REAL time
User: I love that I can use this to wireframe ideas as well as brainstorm
User: there is a slight learning curve that I am still getting used to","Users find Figma valuable for maximizing their small team's efficiency, enabling quick design iterations, and providing an intuitive platform for collaboration. They appreciate the logical organization and notification system. However, they suggest offering help articles and tools tailored to users' varying skill levels and familiarity with the product."
figma,G2,"User: If the people working don't use it properly, they can't organize it and it's difficult to understand the flow
User: You can collaborate on a visual basis as conveniently as a traditional Pygma design file.
User: The document method is open, so there are many possibilities, but I need a default that sparks an idea","Users appreciate Miro for its project management, brainstorming, and collaboration capabilities, as well as its user-friendly interface and features like color-coded sticky notes and templates. However, some users may find it challenging to learn the software, and they wish the free version offered more than three boards."
figma,G2,"User: - collaborative work for the design and marketing teams
User: - easy to setup 
- one prize for everyone 
- easy switch from Miro to FigJam 
- perfect if you already use Figma
User: - you can not use it for a quick workshop and aome free licenses like Miro.","Users appreciate Miro for its virtual whiteboarding and live collaboration capabilities, enabling flexible teamwork and dynamic thought mapping. However, they find it challenging to organize and categorize boards, leading to difficulties in locating specific boards."
figma,G2,"User: We are a fully distributed team and Figjam allows us to work on a problem together and create in real time together
User: Being able to have multiple people at the same time or async work on ideas in one area, quickly and easily is the biggest benefit for our team. There is no barrier of entry and no confusion even if a person is unfamiliar with design products
User: I don't dislike anything about Figjam, if i had to choose something i would say that it would be nice to have more preset options to start from, but the community is already so big","Users appreciate Miro for its centralized design collaboration, visual data sharing, and template features. However, they face challenges with app integration, table functionality, and scaling. Additionally, the interface is not intuitive, making it difficult for new members to learn quickly."
figma,G2,"User: it helps remote team to brainstrom effectively (could be improved)and work together in real time. 
Share the ideas, concepts and design visually in digital space 
App workflow or firmware workflow in a UML way
User: For me being a designer, it made the collaboration with team members much more accessible and efficient. The high is a real-time collaboration with the team this helps in remote working irrespective of the location which helps in work together quickly iterate. Additionally pre made templates and design component accelerates the development.
User: 1. It is limited in options available in terms of brainstorming compare to its competitor. (Interface is very amateur and somewhat clunky) 
2. real time collabration is slow or laggy.","Users find Figma helpful for presentations, reducing meeting durations, and facilitating team collaboration with its user-friendly whiteboarding features. However, they sometimes struggle with navigation when dealing with multiple frames and extensive content."
figma,G2,"User: I think Miro is a very simple tool that comes between Designers and Non-designers to simply communicate through visuals rather than verbally speaking about it. With Miro, in my organization, everyone just simply hop on and draw something to visualize their ideas. I found this significantly helpful to communicate within a team.
User: Miro is the easiest tool to interact with. When it comes to bringing your idea to paper, Miro provides quick solutions such as a broad range of templates, which I like the most. I think for Designers like myself that work closely with POs, it's important to have a tool that both can use.
User: When it comes to organizing the boards, I find it sometimes difficult to find the specific board that I'm looking for. Maybe having the ability to folder the boards could be useful, but also inside boards, I wish I could organize my stuff more. Maybe something like Figma where you can have pages inside each board.","The user finds the virtual event tool interesting and interactive, making remote working easier and more engaging. They appreciate its flexibility and ease of use, but mention that it might be difficult for less tech-savvy participants to participate in meetings. They suggest adding a simple chat option in Miro to allow people to suggest additions."
figma,G2,"User: Creating team structures
User: I was able to hop in and create a team structure in less than 5 minutes with no training. I can't remember a tool this simple.
User: I wish it used AI to tell me what I could improve about the layout of my figjam.","Users appreciate Miro for consolidating scattered information and providing a single source of reference for their team. They find it easy to navigate and enjoy the table features, sticky notes, and embedded comments. However, they face challenges when updating table functions, as using the back button erases all items entered, making editing difficult without losing changes"
figma,G2,"User: When working remote as a product manager, it can be tricky to get everyone on the same page. FigJam allows everyone to share a single space, and it truly feels like you're in the room together. I have used it in situations as the sole driver while sharing my screen with the team to get a quick diagram or mind map put together, and I have also used it collaboratively with my team as a digital whiteboard. You can bring people into FigJam and have them collaborating within minutes whether they are familiar with the tech or not.
User: Being able to join with several colleagues, throw together a quick brainstorm and work quickly has been great! I have used FigJam professionally to lay out calendar schedules, run retros, and run client workshops. It is even valuable to go back to your data and organize everything into a visually consumable map. This is a personal note, but I even used FigJam with my wife (who at the time was on a job away from our home) to lay out our entire wedding floor plan and seating chart!
User: The templates can feel a little daunting, I often can't find *exactly* what I wanted or was looking for, but usually a quick search online or asking colleagues leads me to finding a better template. That, or I just go through and make my own layout because it's just that easy!","Users find Miro helpful for facilitating and documenting collaboration across their team, particularly in remote settings. However, some users find the tool difficult to use and believe it's best suited for real-time collaboration."
figma,G2,"User: It allows me to do dynamic webinar activities. 
Organize the team and better manage group activities. 
Encourages creativity and order. 
It is very comfortable and intuitive and allows everyone to understand it quickly
User: All the things it allows you to do. 
That it is a tool with many possibilities, innovative and intuitive
User: In principle, nothing. I have nothing to highlight","Users find Miro helpful for virtual team brainstorming, mind mapping, and project management due to its flexibility and various features. However, they suggest improvements such as adding labels to any object and making tables easier to work with."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam helps increase collaboration by offering several features in one platform. Users can use basic whiteboard features, but also additional such as those in the Widgets section.
User: FigJam is a great platform to increase interactivity in lessons/activities. The best analogy I heard was it's like Jamboard on steroids.
User: FigJam can be very overwhelming. With all the features, getting lost and unsure where to go and what to do is very easy. With several users at one time, it can get a little chaotic.","User appreciates Miro for enabling remote team collaboration on various tasks but finds it not immediately intuitive, requiring some training for new users to effectively participate in meetings"
figma,G2,"User: Working in a hybrid team, it helps us be abel to solve problems and get everyone on the same page async.
User: Super easy to use remotely and have your designs accessible and linkable.
User: Sometimes the flow charting makes it tougher to reference other boards.","Users find Miro helpful in organizing their team's priorities and appreciate its robust brainstorming features, including various templates and collaboration options. However, they dislike the limitation of collaborating only with team members and wish to include external collaborators on specific boards."
figma,G2,"User: It makes the process of design, especially UX/UI super easy to collaborate on.
User: Collaboration is made so simple and effective.
User: I really don't dislike anything about the program.","Figma users appreciate its ability to create tangible artifacts for ideas and facilitate discussions, as well as the convenience of having all work displayed for meetings. However, they struggle with integrating virtual whiteboards into physical meetings."
figma,G2,"User: client pitches need a strawman
User: the re-useable frameworks are great. Plus the coverage of functional areas are very good
User: I love Miro and dont have any specific comments on drawbacks","Users appreciate Miro for its ability to visualize projects and facilitate mind mapping, which aids in finding solutions and understanding the project as a whole. However, they experience frustration when the platform becomes overloaded with too many elements, causing slow loading times and impacting the user experience."
figma,G2,"User: It solves the same problem as other whiteboard app does. The fact it comes as part of Figma is a huge plus. I might consider using something else if it was a big add-on or wasn't part of the main platform. There are better apps, but the fact that this baked ina s part of Figma is the biggest reason I use it. It's great that it allows me to quickly spin up a board and hammer out visual concepts quickly and I'd happily use this to create UR artifacts, but it has some drawbacks and I wouldn't be able to facilitate some activities.
User: Figjam is a great tool that fulfills a lot of the functionality you get in more advanced whiteboard apps and does more or less a good job of it. The ability to deep-link to elements in a board, and make sections and post-its, is fine and works pretty well.
User: There could be more functionality to format and resize post-its. It'd also be really helpful, for the facilitation of workshop activities, to be able to show and hide sections. this would ideally be on a user or for users or user groups. More mechanics like this, which allows groups of participants and facilitators to work together, would have a positive impact on running workshop activity withing the Figma platform and in FigJam.","Users appreciate Figma for its collaborative features, time-saving templates, and ease of creating visually appealing charts and flows. They also enjoy using Miro for various agency tasks, such as information architecture creation and user experience workshops, due to its user-friendly interface. However, some users experience performance issues on low-end devices when using Chrome browser for large boards, suggesting potential room for performance optimization."
figma,G2,"User: We use Figjam to collaborate even for a presential event it's really pratical for example during a presentation we use it to let others give feedbacks during the presentation.
User: What I find most helpfull in Figjam is the widgets/plugins available that can facilitate workshops (photobooth is my favorite we use it as an icebreaker) the great connexion with Figma also is helpful.
User: Sometimes when we copy/paste desgins from Figma it breakes so we need to screenshot which is not cool. Hide informations can just be done with area I would like to lock informations during voting sessions for example.","Users appreciate Figma's ability to share collections across cross-functional teams and having quality images in one place for multiple users. However, they find it hard to navigate large boards and experience slow loading times."
figma,G2,"User: Creative thinking, guiding thoughts, collaboration..... alot of benefits around structuring thoughts.
User: Flexibility, board templates and easy to learn to use
User: Limit on boards and takes a little while to get used to but thats not really a negative more about the time using it.","The user finds Figma effective for sharing ideas and concepts graphically due to its simple and intuitive interface. However, they feel they might be underusing it and would appreciate a step-by-step guide for new features."
figma,G2,"User: Miro solve the problem of aligning people in a remote meeting and having a shared understanding of what needs to be achieved in the meeting. It also provides a say to prepare strucutre of workshops that are engaging and self documenting.
User: The speed and fluidity of the application makes you able to create concepts and structures on the fly as you are facilitating a meeting. The added controls make for a great facilitator experience.
User: The license model and structure of boards is confusing to people that are infrequent collaborators on the tool. It would be better for security as well if you could include your whole enterprise as users and pay for the number of power users not for idle users that need secure access to boards once per year.","Users appreciate Figma's pre-built templates for creating visual flows and its flexibility, allowing multiple users to work on the same board with real-time updates. However, they find it has a learning curve, making it difficult for new users to navigate easily."
figma,G2,"User: Working remotely and across countries, Miro allows my colleagues to access the board without me being there which helps with my own productivity and meeting deadlines.
User: Great that we can all view the same screen and work on the document together, add notes or make changes.
User: Sometimes the default templates or sticky notes are very small.","Users appreciate Miro for its ability to simplify complex processes and facilitate collaboration among stakeholders. They find the wide range of templates and the built-in timer helpful for project management. However, they suggest developing a desktop app or an offline mode to overcome internet latency issues."
figma,G2,"User: For better designing and to create the diagrams, It is making the requirement easily understandable
User: Way of designing and displaying the each component in such a way that is easily understandable by the devlopers and tester
User: Sometimes different version for the UI update is getting minimize and while maximising the same it is reflecting other versions","Users appreciate Figma for its ease of use and advanced features, which facilitate collaboration on process changes, improvements, and prioritization planning. However, they suggest adding extra snap points on shapes to improve alignment and connection lines."
figma,G2,"User: Visualising the work. Problem expansion, review and solutioning. Inspection of current status. Team connection, fun, team building and collaboration. Assists with the voice space and so easy to use.
User: I find Miro very user-friendly. It's fantastic to collaborate with disbursed teams and is able to contain all the information you desire with links, images, sequenced boards and more. You can use and edit a vast array of templates to meet your purpose or choose one and use it as is.
User: There's not much to dislike about Miro. There are some features I'd like, such as being able to create cutouts of images from shapes and having access to the Miroverse templates within the boards themselves. When my internet is struggling, it slows down my Miro board loading","Users appreciate Figma for its ability to consolidate large amounts of information in one place, reducing paper waste and facilitating efficient organization. However, they experience occasional glitches when boards contain a lot of data."
figma,G2,"User: Collaborate at a distance and regardless of time 
Reduced meeting time
User: I've been comparing other Whiteboards. 
It is fast, easy to use, and can output PDF files. 
It is multifunctional and superior in many ways, such as
User: Admin functions are complex 
Costly for large companies.","The user appreciates Figma's live updates and free usage, but notes that it requires a stable internet connection."
figma,G2,"User: We're able to let go of Whimsical due to the Mindmapping functionality and we're also able to let go of Miro due to the Whiteboard functionality. The best part of it all? It doesn't lag like Miro!
User: I love that FigJam has created an alternative to products like Miro. We used to have to couple Miro with Figma but with FigJam, we're now able to keep to 1 tool!
User: Honestly... Not much to dislike about FigJam with the only caveat being that Figma should continue to listen to and make changes based on customer feedback. This has been the case thus far and I have no reason to believe that this will change.","The user appreciates Figma for its ability to build wireframes for communication and involve a larger group of stakeholders. They like the unrestricted canvas size compared to Word or PowerPoint. However, they suggest adding a feature to export wireframes as PDFs or still images for easier sharing."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam is the one-stop shop for collaboration in my current team, and many teams I've been a part of in the past. It's a our virtual whiteboard for low-fidelity ideation, brainstorming, and alignment activities.
User: I use Figjam daily for all ranges of team collaboration ‚Äì from rapid ideation to flow mapping, and user research planning to facilitating product workshops. It's a critical tool for a remote-first environment, and I always appreciate all the ongoing updates that add to usability, performance, and speed.
User: There's not much to dislike about FigJam since the product has ongoing updates that always seem to address whatever feedback I have! Some additional customization (e.g. background color and styles) could be fun, but the tool is already extremely flexible for all sorts of use cases.","The user appreciates Figma for quickly producing quality visual representations of complex concepts and collaborations, and finds Miro useful for communicating processes and concepts with its extensive templates. However, they suggest improvements in version control and rollback options to prevent unwanted changes."
figma,G2,"User: I want to align item item in center of other object after selection of two or more objects there must be a option to celect the item again to make it the master object than other will be aligned according to it like illustrator. 
 
Thanks
User: Figma jams are really good. Our team uses fig jams to set goals and other info about client things. They are really helpfull in creating user flows details and research kind of stuff. 
 
Thanks.
User: It's really hard for me to find any function that I dislike. It's over all good when We want to alogn items In center of any object there must be a option like illustrator.","Users find Miro useful for aggregating information from multiple tools and enabling real-time collaboration during seminars and training sessions. It is considered more efficient than a physical whiteboard, with features like automatic connection line correction and easy sharing of information. However, users experience slow access times on boards with a lot of information and suggest improving display priority and introducing pop-ups to highlight new or useful features."
figma,G2,"User: It helps me organize a lot of ideas in an aesthetically pleasing way. I can zoom in (figuratively and literally) to details and also see the big picture all at once.
User: I love working in the same space with my colleagues!It's a great way to get a lot of ideas out but then also organize to use later on. The amount of tools available for customization and the high level of design make using Figjam really enjoyable to use.
User: There are some functions that are available in Figma that would be nice to use in Figjam, such as saving an image.","Users appreciate Miro as an online collaboration platform, especially during the COVID-19 lockdowns, for its ability to facilitate various activities like brainstorming, product designs, and wireframes. However, they suggest improvements in the library of wireframe templates and express concerns about the licensing cost compared to low-cost alternatives from larger platforms like Microsoft"
figma,G2,"User: The ability to quickly collaborate on user flows and audit our product with non-designers has been made super quick with the use of FigJam. We are also utilizing FigJam for sprint retros, which allows other roles to become power users of FigJam, benefitting our team using the tool for different purposes and not having another learning curve.
User: I like the speed at which I can collaborate with my teammates for a variety of topics. I spend most of my time using the timer for timebox ceratin conversations around audit and design decisions which we use FigJam for. Additionally, creating user flows within FigJam has been tremendously helpful.
User: Currently, while components are available within FigJam, there isn't an easy way to visibly pull in the components without copying them over from a design file. Additionally, if I want to scale components I've copied into a FigJam, they can not be manipulated, and thus I spend more time jumping back and forth through files rather than having a focused conversation around review/feedback within FigJam.","The user finds Figma relatively user-friendly with a manageable learning curve and appreciates its ability to visually show ideas and thought processes using various mapping tools. However, they find it lacking in aligning formats for creating visually appealing or structured pictures and graphs, requiring manual adjustments."
figma,G2,"User: Fast iteration on anything.
User: I love the simplicity and how fast I can brainstorm ideas / flows etc, with stakeholders, PMs, developers, designers
User: That it is not 100% cross-functional with Figma. Example, I did the flow in FJ, and copied to Figma but then I needed to make some changes to the flow. It is hard to do it in Figma","Users find Miro extremely useful for remote collaboration and as a digital whiteboard with endless space. It offers various tools for brainstorming, mapping customer journeys, and more. However, some users suggest more tutorials to help with understanding its features and usage."
figma,G2,"User: Remote workshops can be done easy and fast. Documentation and re-use of workshop material is possible (compared to offline). Visualization quickly with teams.
User: Drag and drop of all content to structure topics. It very easy to structure brainstorming. Templates are very usefull. Not overloaded is great to keep high usability!
User: Nice transfer to MS Powerpoint missing. Presenation is still done via PPT. Some feature would be great e.g. auto correction on Post-its.","Users appreciate FigJam for its ability to facilitate remote collaboration and capture nuanced ideas in workshops. However, some users find it feature-light and may face challenges when needing more complex solutions."
figma,G2,"User: Miro solves several problems for product managers, including collaboration, ideation and brainstorming, project management, prototyping, and remote work. It provides a centralized platform for product managers to collaborate with their team members and stakeholders, regardless of their location. Miro's digital whiteboard allows product managers to brainstorm and ideate with their team, visually organize their ideas, and prioritize their tasks. It also helps product managers manage their projects effectively, create and manage product roadmaps, user story maps, and agile and Scrum methodologies.
User: Miro is an excellent tool for collaborating and brainstorming with teams remotely. Its vast canvas space, extensive library of pre-made templates, and user-friendly interface make it easy to create and share ideas visually. I particularly like its real-time collaboration feature which allows team members to work together seamlessly, regardless of their location. Overall, Miro is a robust and flexible tool that can be used for various purposes, from project management to creative brainstorming sessions.
User: Miro's pricing structure could be seen as expensive, especially if users only require a few of the advanced features. Our enterprise license charges the same cost per user, even if most staff only use it intermittently. As power users our team gets great value from the product but the accountants just see 60% of the company using it a few times a month and complain loudly. 
If using SSO, shared boards often link to the online version rather than the native app and the constant signing-in can become frustrating.","Users appreciate FigJam for enabling remote whiteboarding sessions and seamless collaboration with colleagues, eliminating the need for physical office presence. However, they note that it requires an additional paid subscription separate from Figma."
figma,G2,"User: Miro helps me as a Design thinking expert and UX Designer to moderate workshops, collect information, synthesize and visualize insights, do creative work and create the first concepts. And all of this in one place and available to the whole team for us all to work collaboratively.
User: That it is super easy to use, team members can be onbarded in no time and can edit and create content without installing anything. Also the great amount of Templates from the community help a lot.
User: I haven't found anything that bothers me, for what I use miro (collaborative work, moderation for workshops) it meets all my expectations","Users appreciate Figma's collaboration features, such as commenting and version history, and its design tools, including animation capabilities. However, they find it expensive for larger teams and lacking in advanced design features compared to other software products."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is serving as a place we can collect images, ideas and more from our clients in the architectural/interior design process. We can message them via Miro in order to keep communication and content in the same ""space"" throughout a project, and all team members can add to it and use it.
User: The interface is very intuitive, I rarely need to read the FAQ on how to use a tool or function. It is versatile in allowing many different tools to be used for visually communication information to clients/teammbmers. We use it in place of Pinterest boards/ style boards for our interior and architectural design services.
User: I sometimes wish the drawings tools were a bit more robust - they seems to be geared toward flow chart style communication. I'd like to be able to sketch free form shapes or have a larger shape library.","The user appreciates Figma and FigJam as a one-stop shop for design and mind mapping, praising its ease of use, stability, and reasonable cost. However, they suggest improving the sharing process, as team account users can currently add editors and charge licenses to the organization, with restrictions requiring an enterprise plan upgrade and increased cost."
figma,G2,"User: During workshops, I mainly use it to brainstorm all together or one after the other as a desynchronized tool when we can not meet all together. I encourage my team to input their ideas directly into Figjam and collaborate to organize the file as a comprehensive reference document for the future of the project.
User: Figjam is a powerful tool for enhancing collaboration and idea visualization. With its real-time collaboration feature and commenting system, teamwork becomes effortless. The file management system and template library are unparalleled among the competition, making it a standout option.
User: Multi account management and several workspaces can make the experience a bit difficult on the daily basis. I often find myself lost searching for my current workspace.","Users appreciate Figma's collaborative features, such as Figjam, which offers tools like whiteboards, mindmaps, and empathy mapping for efficient problem-solving. They also value the ability to comment on designs and receive feedback quickly. Figma is useful for UI design, prototyping, and testing, with powerful tools and community resources. However, the lack of offline functionality and a potentially steep learning curve for beginners are drawbacks."
figma,G2,"User: discussion board. useful for remote sessions
User: Can copy paste components or design from Figma
User: Need to pay extra for collaborators hence not everyone can use it unless you let the open session","The user enjoys using Figma for its accessibility, built-in templates, and collaboration features but suggests integrating popular plugins as out-of-the-box features to enhance the base experience."
figma,G2,"User: Working for a remote async company, Figjam is fundamental for communication, collaboration and alignment.
User: FigJam helps me plan and shape unstructured thoughts and ideas, organise and structure my remote UX Research interview activities and analysis. I simple couldn't live without Figjam
User: I wish the Tables feature was a bit more flexible but for simple tables it does the trick.","Users appreciate Figma's ease of use for drawing and planning design projects, even for non-professionals. They find the features and options, such as drawing different layers, exporting designs, and including comments for collaboration, make it the best design platform for their needs."
figma,G2,"User: We benefit from solving process issues.. mapping current processes, generating ideas and reviewing target state processes. This has helped us visualise the problems regardless of region without having to be there personally.
User: Very user friendly. Not sure how I would have survived without this during the pandemic.. Since then, it has become a part of our daily work. We use this to collaborate between teams.. Share ideas, discuss and review ideas..
User: I find the licensing to be very tedious. My organisation has provisioned limited licenses.. so the others cannot edit the boards when they come to collaborate as they do not have licenses. So we are forced to use personal email accounts to create a free version of the board to collaborate and later transfer to paid version to use all the rich features.. 
 
This is very tedious and needs to be reviewed..","User appreciates the ease of collaboration and deployment of design files within their team, but finds the tool to be resource-intensive and sometimes eats up too much RAM."
figma,G2,"User: It helps mainly with the planning of learning & development strategies and yearly timelines. It makes it easier to work in group.
User: Miro is a very interactive tool that helps to solve many problems at work
User: It could be a little hard to start using (not that intuitive)","Users appreciate Figma for its ease in helping clients visualize website and branding concepts, and its similarity to Adobe products. However, they wish for a feature to include playable videos in prototypes."
figma,G2,"User: Miro provides an ideal software solution for collecting comments and feedback on wireframe designs, showing what they would look like with elements rearranged, and sharing them with others we are collaborating with. 
Team members can review content in their own time and leave post-it notes, comments and annotations with the flexibility to be able to draw, cut and paste etc. to get thoughts across. When we provide our feedback to others, it's very clear which part of the design each piece of feedback relates to and visually shows what we think it should look like.
User: Very flexible, easy to use, intuitive keyboard shortcuts for adding elements to the board make it quick to get thoughts down. Default colours and styles look good. 
Easier to navigate than visio.
User: Doesn't have BPMN symbols, and swimlane structure where space can easily be added in the middle of a diagram so not well suited for process mapping - I still use visio for that.","The user finds the Figma application intuitive and fast, with no cons to report. They have been using the program for 3 months without any complaints."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam is helping us work through complex product logic with clients. As we make bespoke software solutions, we need to understand the core outcomes that a client is looking to achieve and then we can walk them through multiple ways to optimize the process of achieving those outcomes.
User: FigJam is an amazing tool. I often use it for logic flows for internal decisions as well as the logic flows for product decisions with external clients and partners.
User: I wish there were two versions, one for product decision making and then a live/simplified version that could be used during meetings for walking through product decisions with less-technology focused people.","The user appreciates FigJam for creating high-quality decks and presentations for their clients without compromising on pixel quality. However, they find FigJam's interface complicated and had to hire someone familiar with the tool to use it effectively."
figma,G2,"User: Documenting information in diagrams/maps helps the team visualize complex information architecture and align on foundations. 
Sketching ideas in low fidelity increases our time to value at early design stages by allowing us to validate concepts before investing in high-fidelity visualizations. Having a space to collaborate on these low-fidelity designs makes the validation process more efficient and consolidates the thinking. 
Using FigJam to share information with less design-savvy coworkers offers a friendly way to collect and organize inspiration or audits.
User: FigJam makes it easy for me to sketch ideas, map information in diagrams, and collaborate with others. There's just enough design functionality to bring concepts to life without getting lost in the details. Additional tools make workshops or brainstorming sessions fun and easy for my non-designer colleagues to pick up. I love having access to community-made templates and graphics for inspiration.
User: I wish participants could be invited to edit files without having a licensed seat. I have run interactive workshops with participants who do not regularly use the tool, and getting folks proper access in these cases is a bit tricky. In cases where I have colleagues who need temporary access to files, I use open sessions, but need to reopen them each time the colleague requires edit access.","Users appreciate Miro as a common platform for collaboration and visualization, which helps in daily presentations and organizing Agile events. However, they suggest improving the pen functionality for a smoother writing experience and propose the addition of a touchpad for more natural drawing"
figma,G2,"User: Allows us to map user flows and processes while annotating and linking relevant materials.
User: Miro gives us a platform to collaborate and share insights as a team. I particularly like the use of sticky notes, colour choices to differentiate flows and its unlimited space.
User: Only real downside is the access to boards in my organisation. Being shared a link does not give you access which I understand but can be yime consuming to gain access.","The user finds FigJam valuable for their team, as it enables efficient collaboration on low-fidelity wireframes, visual designs, and ideation on a shared canvas. They appreciate its real-time collaboration, intuitive interface, and integration with other Figma products and third-party apps like Slack. However, they find the cursor chat feature odd."
figma,G2,"User: Great for virtual workshops with multiple people being able to contribute live
User: Voting option is great for getting instant feedback
User: Can be a little slow at times when there are multiple users","Users find FigJam helpful for onboarding clients, collaborating with designers, developers, and clients, and simplifying UI/UX design. However, they face challenges with limited control over text font and find it slightly difficult to onboard clients compared to Miro."
figma,G2,"User: Collaborative whiteboard. Ability to share thoughts on the fly wihout restriction and sharing our screenspace
User: Flexibility to add people into the project and no restriction of zoom in and zoom out. 
Also we can restrict who can and who can't. 
Ability to login using email from anywhere (multiple logins).
User: Need a bit more libraries/ packages to have bit more funkyier than what it is.","The product is helping users by providing easier collaboration for remote teams, as well as giving them oversight on work and the ability to document in a single location, which increases visibility and engagement amongst team members. Users appreciate the product's oversight for projects, its intuitive design, and its ability to integrate other apps and features. Users experience fatigue when zooming in and out, and find it difficult to create visuals and diagrams that are interactive. They also find it difficult to copy and paste elements from other sources into Miro, and wish they could consolidate their personal and work accounts."
figma,G2,"User: Sharing ideas, knowlede and developing solutions - mostly interactivelty and with collaboration.
User: Easy to use intuitive diagramming which covers most business scenarios you could wish for . Really easy to work collaboratively and simultaneously.
User: Not much - sharing is a bit confusing at times but other than than can't think of anything significant.","User is benefiting from Miro's range of templates, diagrams, and sticky notes which make it easy to share complex ideas visually, resulting in improved collaboration and a more efficient workflow. The User finds Miro to be an incredibly powerful tool for collaborating with teams, due to its easy-to-use interface and real-time collaboration features. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features are highly customizable, allowing for greater flexibility when working on projects. Users may find the pricing structure of Miro to be expensive for smaller teams or individuals, and the extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users. However, Miro provides helpful support resources such as video tutorials and a user community to help users get up to speed quickly."
figma,G2,"User: Team structure, Product Kanban mapping, Process Diagrams, Solution mappying
User: The general simplicity of use, the templates and the ability to collaborate with many colleagues in real time make it for me. The feeling of soooo much space to put down and work through any idea, ensure inclusion and the ability to quickly zoom in and out to focus on what is being worked through help group discussion move forward no end. I also find Miro particularly helpful in structuring and formulating my own thoughts on how to approach tricky problems.
User: I feel like Miro has more tools available to me and more potential integration ability that i am aware of. More easy to access examples of Miro use could be beneficial!","sers appreciate FigJam's collaborative and creative environment, which promotes active participation and diverse perspectives. They find its features, such as sticky notes, shapes, freehand drawing and various templates, versatile for various projects. However, they face challenges when integrating FigJam with design tools other than Figma, making collaboration difficult"
figma,G2,"User: ALLOWS LARGE AND REMOTE TEAMS TO COLLABORATE TOGETHER - ITS ALSO A GREAT TOOL FOR CAPTURING NOTES THAT CAN BE LATER ADDED TO OR FURTHER COLLABORATED ON WITH DIFFERENT TEAMS WITHIN DIFFERENT TIME ZONES AT DIFFERENT TIMES TOO
User: THE ABILITY TO COLLABORATE WITH COLLEAGUES IN A EASY AND QUICK MANNER, ESPECIALLY IN A WORKING FROM HOME ENVIRONMENT
User: SOMETIMES, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE MIRO BOARD, THE BOARD CAN BE A LITTLE SLOW TO LOAD WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE FRUSTRATING","Users appreciate Miro's intuitive interface and the ability to collaborate easily with colleagues using the embedded teams feature. They find it useful for various tasks, from quick workshops to full-fledged service blueprints. However, they experience occasional slowdowns and lagging, especially with large boards."
figma,G2,"User: Having an always available at any device and anywhere white board.
User: Easy to use, does not get's in the way, and available to everyone.
User: It's missing a more structured grid system, an hybrid with Excel formats.","Users appreciate MIRO for its ease of sharing work, voting sessions, diverse templates, and various features for visual boards, agile management, brainstorming, and mind maps. However, they find creating UML diagrams less user-friendly compared to other tools, due to issues with auto-resizing and linking between boxes."
figma,G2,"User: Online version of having all the team members in the same room, looking at the same whiteboard and capturing their ideas in one place.
User: Best collaboration tool. 
Great for brainstorming. 
Great for visual representation of ideas. 
Love the massive canvas that never seems to end and can help host historical data that is easily accessible.
User: Sometimes the desktop app takes ages to load. 
Also, often asks to login when I've alredy registered from the device. Will be great to introduce smarts to recognise device and avoid login in prompt.","User finds Miro easy to use and effective for planning events, workshopping solutions, and creating visual timelines. They appreciate the variety of shapes and colors for collaboration. However, they suggest providing tutorials for individual users to explore new ways to utilize the tool in a small public sector organization"
figma,G2,"User: Great app for teams which are located in different geos. Helps to get everyone on a single platform to share ideas, conduct agile ceremonies and get strategic ideas from all.
User: Great collaboration platform. Helps during workshops with the team for project and strategy planning. User friendly app and will recommend to all
User: Currently it isnt widely used accross communities. Will be great if more people are onboarded on this platform.","The user found Figma helpful for virtual collaboration during lockdown, despite initial challenges with latency and accidental deletions. Upgrades have improved the experience."
figma,G2,"User: We use Miro for collaborative activities such as Brainstorm sessions, reviews, and as a tool for any diagram, we might need.
User: powerful collaboration mechanisms 
super easy to start, even for somebody with no experience 
range of templates available
User: Took some time for me to understand how to add something from a template and not create a new board for that.","The product is helping the User to collaborate with colleagues more easily when working remotely. The User likes that Miro makes it easy to share the progress of a research project in a novel way, as well as being useful to share findings and collaborate in group sessions. The User sometimes finds difficulty navigating and moving items around the board, as well as unintended arrows being drawn."
figma,G2,"User: Significant challenge of distributing information effectively when working remotely with a cross-functional team
User: Ease of overall use of the platform. It is intuitive enough that no training is required. Aesthetically pleasing
User: It might be sluggish at times. Loading the boards might take too long at times. When moving the flows on the board, there is occasionally a lag.","Users appreciate Miro for its collaboration features in a hybrid environment, variety of dynamic templates, and ease of personalization. However, they find it challenging when multiple people work on the same page, which can be mitigated by locking items to prevent changes."
figma,G2,"User: Building a plan for the department, or the companies strategy dependencies and building clear stratucres
User: The collaborative function and availability of the different tools ‚Äì¬†design,
User: The way the drag works, if you move the items with the pointer it will drop it out of the greed","The user appreciates the fluid functionality and excellent UX design of FigJam, which helps organize thoughts and ideas within teams and facilitates collaboration projects. They find it intimidating initially, but once they learn the basics, it is straightforward and functional."
figma,G2,"User: It replaced physical whiteboards for discovery and brainstorming sessions. It also works as an excellent ice-breaker and teambuilding tool to have everyone active during meetings or learning sessions.
User: For those who miss physical whiteboards and post-its this is the solution to easily (and virtually) visualize projects and organize brainstorming, project management and workflow visualization. It's very friendly, intuitive and compatible with other tools.
User: Some toolboxes usually overlap important information, and sharing options are not that easy to understand and use, mainly with external (not frequent) users.","Users find Miro to be an effective collaboration tool that helps run meetings smoothly, reduces manual work, and saves costs. They appreciate its user-friendly interface, available templates, sharing capabilities, and affordability. Miro has positively impacted their workplace, and they have no significant dislikes about the tool."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is helping us structuring our ideas and content in our creative and innovative tasks, as well as engaging with clients in business discovery sessions.
User: Miro has a seamless collaborative user experience and is always available online for anyone we want to connect to our content.
User: Using the right mouse button to move around the board... It is not as intuitive as clicking the board layer and moving it around.","Users appreciate Figma's easy collaboration, intuitive interface, and fast onboarding process. However, they face challenges with oversized inserted images and organization of grouped elements, which can be confusing when dealing with numerous elements."
figma,G2,"User: These days when 90% of people works from home - this is the new ""on the wall"" board I always had in the past. I especially like that I can have one board for a more comlex topics and people cooperating on sub-topics and then generalizing within the same space.
User: Flexibility. Featers that allow me to address any type of meetings. I especially like a bit more advanced features like boards - that go beyond holding shapes on the board.
User: I would love to have in house merge with excel (or some other way to be able to use and upload data to the board). Sometimes it's easier in a big company to get budget for a big event, than to get couple $ for a miro plug in, and being able to drive colaboration on the board and have some data feed somewhere else, would be a huge help for me.","Users appreciate Miro's visual-dominant approach for product and project planning, as well as the wide variety of ready-to-use templates. However, they experience performance issues with heavy-in-pictures boards and suggest a feature to optimize graphics settings for better performance"
figma,G2,"User: During and after Covid many people were working from home when they are unwell. It is hard to make all required participants to come to a workshop physically. Miro resolves this issue.
User: It is easy for new users to start. It provides a platform similar to a workshop in a room with participants there in person. 
I also like the templates provided which are inspiring to plan how the workshop can be conducted.
User: Sometimes it takes a while (about 30 sec) to load a board the first time.","Users appreciate Miro's collaboration features, ease of sharing boards with clients, and variety of tools for creating boards. However, they dislike that clicking a shared link opens the board in both the website and native app, causing duplication."
figma,G2,"User: Figma Jam's customizable templates and intuitive interface make it easy for me to unleash my creativity and explore new ideas in a structured, collaborative environment.
User: Easy to use: Figma Jam is intuitive and easy to use, even for those who are new to the Figma design tool. The interface is straightforward, and the toolset is simple, making it accessible to all team members.
User: Internet-dependent: Figma Jam is an online tool that requires an internet connection to use. This means that users may experience latency or connectivity issues that can slow down collaboration.","The user found Figma helpful in documenting their sales process and customer journey, appreciating the easy-to-use templates. They were initially unaware of its integration with Figma but found it impressive once discovered."
figma,G2,"User: It enhance seamless team communication and collaboration. 
It is simple to plan and manage agile workflows and projects with Miro. 
It's simple to create,edit and share whiteboard with this tool.
User: With Miro,it's simple to brainstorm and share ideas with others in real-time.I like how this tool allows me to communicate and collaborate with my teams seamlessly.It is simple to share files using this tool.It is easy and fast to run online meeting and team workshops efficiently with Miro.
User: Miro work's perfectly and without any hindrance when having stable internet connectivity.","Users appreciate FigJam's collaborative features, intuitive interface, and versatility for remote teams, making it suitable for brainstorming, wireframes, and user flows. However, it lacks advanced design features compared to other design tools, limiting its use for more complex design work."
figma,G2,"User: It's ideal for collaborating remotely with team members. The Jira cards are helpful when there are action items that need to be sent to the teams backlog for action.
User: The canvas design allows me to use frames and create any diagram that is needed. It's countless templates, apps integrations, presentation features, emojis, stickers and the new 'AI' component that groups sticky notes by themes or sentiments is a delight. I also like and leverage the hide, lock frame and the timer features. The announcement of new features comes handy as well.
User: I've noticed some hiccups when sharing boards with free license users that require to actively collaborate on the board.","Users appreciate Figma's powerful features, including Figjam, add-ons, and prototyping capabilities, which enable them to create and collaborate on visual designs effectively. However, some users find the interface overwhelming initially and may encounter unexpected behavior due to enabled settings."
figma,G2,"User: Colaborative diagrams, with no need to download any software. 
 
Also the ability to do workflows/mindmaps in a very simple way. 
 
I am starting to use miro as project management.
User: It is beautiful and easy to use. I love when I have a need and I can solve it in a matter of seconds. 
 
Also the ability to connect boxes, interfaces and zoon in and out is a good thing to use.
User: You cannot export to power point. This is the most frustating thing as you expend time to create a beautifil workflow or canvas and you cannot add it to your presentation.","The user finds the tool helpful for creating wireframes and designs for their work, but finds it challenging to use initially due to its complexity and discomfort."
figma,G2,"User: Our Design team needed a tool that is easy to use and with good documentation and training available. This tool also needed to be able to share with anyone in the company. By having organization in the tool (teams, pages, etc.) , it also makes it easy to find what is needed.
User: An easy-to-use tool that allows Design to easily design needed user journeys and feature mocks. They can then easily share with their team(s) and make changes on the fly when needed. The UI is fairly intuitive as well.
User: Maybe it's just me but I found it a bit hard to learn the controls to navigate the tool as someone new to it. Took me longer than I like to admit to know how to zoom in and move around properly. This is likely a me issue more than a UI issue but I wanted to mention it.","The user appreciates the flexibility and timer function of the tool, but finds it difficult to see other members' boards and suggests improving the board design to make it easier to identify projects."
figma,G2,"User: Helps all designers, tech and product managers to collaborate and conduct workshops. Helps a lot in design process and taking ideas to main design board easily.
User: - how we can take brainstorming to deisgn board and back and forth in process 
- pre- defined posted and shapes 
- comments tracking 
- and team calling sessions, makes collaboration easy
User: - mobile application is not well 
- more colour customisation in posted notes as it does not serve well not larger groups 
- documents imports","Users find Figma helpful for prototyping and wireframing mobile apps and web landing pages, as it is less restrictive and easier to use than other design applications like Photoshop. However, they mention that it requires a fast and stable internet connection, as all work is saved to the cloud, suggesting that offline functionality would be a valuable addition."
figma,G2,"User: Our team uses FigJam to both collect and organize data when planning product updates, and we also use it to visually map out user workflows. This lets us demo the experience internally while taking real-time notes that can be shared with the whole team.
User: For UX design and team collaboration in a remote work environment, FigJam is an excellent way to design product workflows and collaborate with various team members. The controls are intuitive, and it's easy to track comments and changes.
User: I don't have any negative comments about FigJam as my experience has been nothing but positive. It's allowed me as a Product Marketer to collaborate effectively with both designers and engineers.","The user appreciates the colorful board, sticky, and other features that keep people busy and interactive, as well as the ability to interact on the same board for clarity and interactivity. They also suggest adding timers for specific sticky or date-based boards."
figma,G2,"User: Day to day design needs
User: I love the fact how flawlessly I am able to make different screens with the tool, I can simply work on cloud with my team mates and I love than back slash feature to chat with team mates
User: They only provide 2 pages in free version please increase the no of pages","User loves the product's day-to-day UX and its ability to work with teammates simultaneously, but finds that exporting files in a single PDF is not possible."
figma,G2,"User: The ability to have an interactive workshop online that is collaborative and impactful.
User: I love that you can collaborate with everyone at the same time truly. Building out the space for the collaboration is easy to do, allowing it to be prepared ahead of time. You can move between presentation mode and working mode quickly. Miro has made my workshops much more interactive. 
 
I love the built-in grouping and voting functionality. These provide a level of quick feedback you often to do receive in collaboration tools.
User: The number 1 item is don't count on everyone having received your invite to the board when you share. If you need someone in a meeting, you must have them validate prior that they have access. Often I have invited people, and then we have had to search for a way to get them in. I think this happens if they have an account already in place. 
 
There is also trouble with some of the functionality - you can Ctrl/V to paste but if you use the past from the menu often it doesn't work effectively... also things come in very small and you may have to go in search of where they were pasted.","Users appreciate Figma's FigJam as a highly collaborative tool with an easy-to-use interface, allowing for seamless teamwork through features like sticky notes and frames. They have no dislikes after using it for two years."
figma,G2,"User: It has a larger workspace than what I typically use in Microsoft Powerpoint. Allows for a much larger workspace to create in and can shift easily between different sections.
User: Miro provides a great whiteboarding experience for our teams as they work together with others in a virtual strategic planning environment. I love that we can set up custom boards, or pull in examples from others as well and modify them to meet our needs. There are a lot of great features that I still need to explore to make sure I'm getting the most of out of this tool.
User: I still feel like there is a lot to learn about how best to use this system. I've sat through a few trainings, but it's not always easy to know how to use the various features within the tool, and how to help others take advantage of these features. The connection to our agency planning platform works, but always requires us to log in before we can access within that system. Because the Miro access shuts off after just a few hours, it requires me to log in frequently to make sure it continues to work successfully in our system as I'm setting up a session, or trying to work on sessions with others. It would be great if we could log in once and have it work consistently if I'm on the same computer or at least be good for 24 hours of access.","The user finds Figma valuable for team collaboration, brainstorming, idea consolidation, timeline and roadmap creation, and documentation. They appreciate its user-friendly interface, connections, and capabilities, and have used it for various purposes, including project retrospectives and wireframing dashboards. The user suggests optimizing mouse scrolls for easier navigation within a board, but overall, they are highly satisfied with the tool."
figma,G2,"User: The ability to have a collaborative planning session or discovery session is the main reason I use the miro tool. It makes it easy for everyone to visually see the flow of data as well.
User: Miro makes complex discovery, planning, and process discussions into a simple, collaborative tool, allowing the full team to see and tell the same story. The use cases for Miro are endless whether you are in the Project, Product, or Engineering space, there are templates and activities at your fingertips aimed at collaboration.
User: Sometimes connecting shapes together is buggy and more difficult than it should be. I also wish there was a better way to connect Miro into powerpoint or another exported solution.","Users find Miro easy to use with helpful features for diagramming and appreciate its diverse templates that support various use cases, including project management and feedback gathering. However, they mention the lack of integration with other services like Notion and the absence of screen reading capabilities for visual accessibility, which prevents their organization from adopting it more widely."
figma,G2,"User: It helps me create design prototypes to get user feedback early on.
User: Great for prototyping and for wireframing. Handy plugins and UI tooling.
User: Not too many options to export designs to different (including local) formats.","Users appreciate Miro's digital whiteboard solution for agile team collaboration, roadmap planning, and daily standups. They enjoy the colors, flexibility, and drag-n-drop approach for creating slides and presentations. Although there is a time cost for attending beginner classes, the instructors are engaging and enthusiastic, making it easy to learn Miro efficiently."
figma,G2,"User: Miro brings people closer - you can be in a different country or just working from home, it really helps you to easily visualize and structure things and eases collaboration
User: Miro helped us through covid! When the pandemic hit we started to use the software to keep on working together, do workshops, etc. 
But even afterwards we kept on using it to collaborate with our collague abroad and to bring our ideas together and facilitate visualizing and structuring our thoughts. 
Really great tool for collaboration, especially when you're apart from your colleagues for any reason.
User: I really love Miro, not much to dislike about it. 
Maybe just that it takes very long to load some boards and the app was also crashing sometimes. 
Otherwise you can accidentally move around things if you forget to lock them and some shapes are not very handy to write something in them (I notice I end up using more post-its because of the size of text/formatting limitations).","Users appreciate Figma as a centralized platform for notes, priority discussions, and retrospective meeting notes, as well as for reviewing and providing feedback on designs and documents. However, they experience occasional slow performance."
figma,G2,"User: Ability to quickly and easily brain dump solutions or concepts
User: Very easy to collaborate virtually across teams
User: Need to lock items to prevent users moving them accidentally","The User is benefiting from the product by being able to collate many screenshots and add notes, which allows for more collaboration between viewers. It is also easy to pick up and use, although a start screen for a project would be beneficial for casual users. The User enjoys using Miro for individual work projects and team collaboration. They appreciate the infinite canvas for getting ideas out, as well as the tools for creating lightweight tables and timelines. The User also finds the collaboration tools to be very good. The User finds Miro useful for collating and sharing information, but not as good for linear presentations. They would like a link to share that makes it easier to open and view the information linearly before getting to the full canvas view."
figma,G2,"User: a place to work collaboratively with other team members when on Webex
User: The scrolling in and out for navigating around the board. It is even easier with a trackball mouse. 
Also like the way you can link to JIRA 
You don't need to be a technical person to use it.
User: When pasting pictures, sometimes they are blurred when you zoom in. It would be nice to have more giffs usage :)","Users appreciate Figma for online diagramming and collaboration among hybrid teams, as well as its variety of templates. However, they suggest improvements such as capturing frame titles when exporting to PDF, setting default zoom to 100%, organizing blocks in diagrams, adding double arrows to connectors, and showing overlapping connectors when crossing another connector."
figma,G2,"User: Serving as a one-stop-shop for designing and planning an intensive leadership course; delivering the course itself (various group and individual activities will be performed in a Miro board); team collaboration and content visualization.
User: Nearly limitless toolset coupled with intuitive functionality; plays nicely with links, pasted and imported resources, and videos; allows you to dump, organize and map all the various pieces of a vast (or simple) project; offers amazing opportunities for team / group collaboration; insanely useful tool not just for planning but for presentation as well - can also easily be leveraged as a (FUN!) teaching tool. New features and integrations are continually added, so even if something isn't possible or easy now, you can bet it will be added soon.
User: While intuitive, there can be a bit of a learning curve for new users (for instance, learning how to pull oneself across the board versus grabbing and moving board items). Board owners must be thoughtful in locking or hiding items they don't want moved or deleted ahead of time to ensure visitors don't inadvertently mess up your masterpiece. There are still some hard-to-explain quirks - for instance, some URL links (for whatever reason) show up as just links when pasted, whereas others show up as a summary snapshot of the resource.","The user appreciates the ability to create Agile retrospectives, root cause analysis, and visualizing a road map, as well as the ability to interactively edit tasks in a schedule. They also appreciate the flexibility of the Miro template for Fishbone diagrams, but wish for a user-defined zoom percentage."
figma,G2,"User: Customer ceremonies, like Discovery, PDCA and all collaboratives meetings we have. It is excellent because we can do it 100% remotely, so scheduling these meetings is easier. We can do customer ceremonies more often.
User: I love how we can use MIRO for collaborative meetings and Discovery ceremonies because it is easy to use, and many people can interact differently from PowerPoint, for example. 
In addition, templates are awesome
User: Unfortunately, some tools are complex, like frames, searching, selecting and moving forms. I mean the usability itself: clicking and performing these actions isn't easy. Sometimes MIRO takes a long time to open, but I cannot confirm whether is MIRO or Internet performance.","Users appreciate Figma as a convenient platform for remote collaboration, offering a wide range of templates for various purposes, and enabling easy sharing and brainstorming. They also value its ability to animate process flows and integrate with Microsoft Office and Google Platforms."
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration during brainstorming sessions used to be everyone looking at the same notepad as one individual writes notes. Now everyone is involved in brainstorming and setting up group activities is so easy in the app!
User: The speed at which workflows can be drawn when explaining the process on the board and how easy it is to set up a table and move columns and rows around. It's faster and sleeker than Microsoft competitors.
User: Sometimes when changing how my device is configured with screens/mouse/keyboard, the navigation around the board can change. For example, I use a tablet computer, and if I remove my mouse, then it changes for touchpad navigation. I feel like it could remain consistent in navigation unless I change it.","Users find FigJam easy to use for diagramming workflows and processes, and appreciate its seamless collaboration features for both internal and external stakeholders. However, they note some limitations in shape and color choices when building out flows."
figma,G2,"User: A diverse and easily accessible whiteboard tool for use during meetings or to collaborate on early-stage ideas. 
Collaborative brain dump before meeting to introduce topics or after meetings to record toughts.
User: Easy to create and share dashboards. 
Tagging features are nice. 
Drag and drop file features work well. 
Live sessions are easy to start and work well as a collaborative space to work during meetings.
User: Integrations with other apps are surface-level. 
There is no baked-in intelligence to the organization of connected objects. 
Large boards become very slow and hard to use.","Users appreciate Miro's flexibility, functionality, and ability to visually communicate inefficiencies to internal clients. They also enjoy the collaboration features. However, they find copying graphics between boards frustrating, as it doesn't always maintain the original formatting."
figma,G2,"User: Miro solves the issue of having an online space to do all things idea generation + organisation. The interface keeps it simple with the toolbar so you don't get bogged down by the full functionality, but it's there if you need the extra help with structuring information (eg. using templates)
User: Miro is a great platform for brainstorming and idea generation. I use it frequently at work for workshops, as the live collaboration tools make it easy to present and gather feedback. 
 
I like using the sticky notes to structure sections and cluster ideas together. This especially comes in handy when taking notes / synthesising research!
User: - Formatting (bullet points) 
- Image/object alignment 
- Connecting lines between shapes can be clunky/limiting",The user appreciates Figma's unified collaborative space for their large team and its ability to organize multiple projects and tasks. They suggest adding AI integration to help users choose the right templates for their objectives.
figma,G2,"User: Mainly digital transformation planning and solution design development and communication. The ability to collaborate remotely accelerates progress.
User: Ease of use is the best 'feature', very easy for new users to get started and gaining benefit from collaborating on diagrams, designs, analysis, brainstorming.... Then it's easy to gradually start using more advanced features as you go. 
As a more experienced/advanced user I like: 
- the wide range of templates 
- icons 
- voting functionality 
- tables/grids
User: I think the board organisation coukd be better. Especially when you move from a free account to a paid account, the filing system can get a bit disjointed.","The User finds Figjam beneficial for designing website wireframes, as it helps them to organize their ideas into a presentable mindmap. This makes the design process more enjoyable. The User has been using Figma for years and is very satisfied with the value it provides. They believe Figma and Canva are better than Adobe. The User is unable to access Figma from a mobile device."
figma,G2,"User: Miro helps solve group collaboration on final presentations. I had been using InDesign before, but couldn't get everyones eyes on my document quickly. The ability to brainstorm, and share notes when conducting research has also been an important part for my team, with some members having fully remote positions.
User: The thing I find most helpful with Miro is the collaboration. Instead of sharing versions of documents around, or trying to record physical notes in a way for my whole team to see, we all have the most current online version that is easy to work with and create beautiful designs.
User: There are few downsides to using Miro, sometimes others feel intimidated by using it, but usually, that changes quick. I use Miro to create presentations and designs, which works well and creates high-resolution documents, and while it offers more flexibility in design than PowerPoint, I have to be creative to get the designs I want.","Users appreciate Miro's ability to facilitate remote collaboration in a hybrid work environment, especially during the pandemic. They find it valuable for documenting workshops, capturing ideas, and brainstorming. However, they mention minor issues with table functionality and shape modification for wireframing."
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration. By allowing different people to work on the boards simultaneously with no issues. Documenting projects. Bye providing different tools of diagraming and presenting information that can be also exported as images.
User: I like how easy it is to start using it, the first time and every day, as soon as I open it I feel I'm already getting work done. I love that is collaborative and new features work grat for team or solo work.
User: The permissions configuration is kind of tricky when being part of a large organization. I know that is responsibility of the company but Miro's error and fallback messages could be more clear to help understand the origin of the problem and how to fix it quickly."," Users find MIRO helpful for managing complex project schedules, product roadmaps, and facilitating collaboration across teams. They appreciate its visual appeal, ease of use, and infinite space. However, they would like to see improved integration with MS Excel for seamless updates between the two platforms."
figma,G2,"User: virtual sessions and realtime collaboration, versioning of boards, ease of sharing and access management, Jira integration which enhances our workflow, visual presenting and storytelling with ability to directly impact and itterate the board
User: ease of use, familiarity of navigation accross the board, robust intergration with 3rd party tools, availability in browser and app, sleek UI, usefullness covering multiple working use cases (workshops, internal meetings, meeting minutes, personal ToDo's and mappings etc.)
User: from business feedback - still hard to comprehend for ""non visual"" people, option to add more fonts/customization, board customization management and options , more music options when timer is on","The user appreciates the low-cost collaborative tool Miro for its ability to facilitate virtual meetings and solve complex business objectives. They find the tool intuitive but wish it had preset options for mouse and keyboard functions, similar to a preferred controller setup for gaming systems."
figma,G2,"User: It allows me to facilitate remote workshops and keep track of the ideas shared.
User: A lot of features that enable collaborative sessions.
User: Difficulty in organizing the space e find items previously created.","Users appreciate Miro as their top choice for collaboration with clients, as it allows real-time feedback, process documentation, and easy onboarding. It is particularly useful for remote teams and different time zones. However, users face issues with size capacity, slow performance with too many screenshots, messy boards, and minor formatting problems."
figma,G2,"User: Miro makes my creative, collaborative workflow more efficient. With it, my whole team can add ideas and visuals of the specific part of the project they are responsible for in one single place. Without having to make a lot of meetings or building presentations that are not as fast to be edited, we can make alignments and approvals.
User: What I like most about Miro is that I'm able to create an online, easily accessible from a computer or phone, blank page where I can connect and create with my team at the same time. It gives us endless possibilities to be creative and to organize everything in the same place.
User: The only thing I dislike about Miro is when the board has too much content, and the platform starts to be very slow to edit and freezes. Making sure Miro works smoothly, even with heavy boards, is the only thing I see as a need right now.","The user appreciates Figma's flexibility for creating storyboards, mind mapping, and collaborative workshops, as well as its formatting support and navigation. However, they experience issues with the zoom tool being jumpy when handling large files with many PDFs and lagging during video calls on MS Teams or Zoom."
figma,G2,"User: Helps me bring stakeholders on the page; helps me materialize strategic work and helps have a solid basis for all design work.
User: Almost all features! From templates, miroverse, post-its, shapes, cards etc. to all the flexibility of having an infinite board.
User: The main issue I face are when the server needs reconnecting. On a few occasions I have lost work because of that, and in a workshop can be embarrassing.","Users find Figjam to be an excellent replacement for traditional in-person whiteboarding, as it facilitates collaboration across remote and in-person teams in various scenarios, such as design, brainstorming, and strategy sessions. However, there is a slight learning curve to get accustomed to the UI and accessing different elements."
figma,G2,"User: To create the ideas.
User: I can do brain storming through Miro as if we are using real white board. Also, it's great to continue the discussion with the same white board next time.
User: Sometimes, it is too heavy to use. Some participants who have weak network struggle.","Users appreciate Miro for its ease of use, real-time collaboration, and ability to capture ideas effectively. However, they face issues with forced password protection on public boards, confusing UX for inviting external participants, and limited permission options for locking objects across teams."
figma,G2,"User: I can develop my processes in one place and show the progress' creation steps. I can share my work progress whit my colleagues and leadership team consistently and clearly. I believe that my productivity had increased.
User: Miro is intuitive and well-organised, and its collaboration capabilities work great in hybrid environments. I often use Miro for its presentation capabilities. What is very compelling is the visual representation and vibrance of available tools bring presentations to life and give them the right flavour.
User: As intuitive as Miro is, some elements may require more development, like the options for diagramming; it would be great to export diagrams directly to Viso or other flow or diagramming tools. Often diagrams must be inserted into documentation that is outside of Miro.","The user finds the product useful for Scrum Master ceremonies, such as Sprint Retrospectives and PI Planning, and appreciates its ease of use for multiple purposes. They also mention that they have to reload Miro every time they switch to another tab and return to it."
figma,G2,"User: Being able to collaborate with colleagues in a virtual space is fundamental for remote working. It has also made my research activities easier to manage and more accessible within the business. From team building sessions, retrospectives, or working solo - it honestly is a game changer and I can't imagine how we would manage without it.
User: I honestly cannot rate Miro highly enough. It has become an essential part of remote working for me since I was introduced to it in 2020, and one of the most advanced whiteboard tools I have come across. 
 
In my current role as a UX Researcher, I use Miro for facilitating workshops and analysing and synthesising research. I can dedicate an entire board to a research project and give stakeholders a space that they can refer back to at any time. I also embed my project boards in our internal Confluence pages, which allows my colleagues to interact with the board without having to leave the page. 
 
Other features I find useful are: 
- The vast amount of templates available 
- Giving presentations directly from Miro 
- The addition of a private mode 
- 'Show author' on stickies 
- I'm really excited to try the new 'talkback' feature! 
 
It's very intuitive to use so the barrier for entry is extremely low. I often lead workshops with people that aren't very technical and seldom have any issues with people trying to learn how to use Miro's features.
User: Exporting stickies to CSV format with the columns and rows in the correct order can be a bit fiddly. I have to manually separate columns into rows whilst trying to maintain the integrity of the data. Perhaps there could be/is a way to tabulate stickies in bulk within Miro but I haven't found an easy way to do this yet. 
 
I often run out of sticky note colours and would really like to be able to use my own custom colours like you can with frames and shapes. I would love some more themes for diagramming and flow charts, or the ability to save a set of custom colours as a theme for diagramming shapes.","Users appreciate Figma's seamless collaboration experience across multiple regions, especially for project kick-offs and workshops. Clients find it easy to use, and it helps display information in a more digestible way. However, some users find the membership and board access management confusing and suggest simplifying it."
figma,G2,"User: Miro allows me to create and adapt the board to any structure / goal I have and is flexible enough to support various use cases. At thesame time, Miro offers a lot of templates in the Miroverse which educate and inspire me to create better collaboration touchpoints.
User: Miro is my main collaboration toll with my peers and stakeholders. I use iton a daily basis as to create shared understanding of concepts, roadmaps, work to be done, reflect on the results and outcomes and workshop potential solutions. 
 
It's easy to navigate and customize to any type of meeting.
User: I have noticed that for my colleagues who do not have experience with miro or similar tools, the UX can appear complex and overwhelming. In these cases, I spend 5 min in the beginning of the meeting to educate them on how to use the tool.","Users appreciate Figma for enabling collaborative design of visual roadmaps, OKRs, and brainstorming sessions. They find it easy to share and organize projects with co-workers. However, they feel that the templates could be more visually appealing and faced difficulty renewing their annual subscription."
figma,G2,"User: Let's multiple teams come together to brainstorm virtually while also allowing us unlimited space
User: User-friendliness of the overall tools & interface
User: Text editing / copying / pasting could be improved","Users find Miro helpful for brainstorming, prototyping, and creating flowcharts due to its real-time collaboration and easy sharing features. However, they express a desire for integration with Microsoft PowerPoint to enhance presentations and leverage Miro's superior graphic tools."
figma,G2,"User: It bring transparency and visibility to team members' work and feedback. It makes us to keep our artifacts living and any time ready to be updated collaboratively.
User: The ready Miro templates expedites our deliverables and it make our sessions super collaborative and efficient irrespective of our location either in the office or while working remotely.
User: Copying the content from and to MS Office is challenging; especially not being able to copy paste a table from Excel. Also, grouping the cards for bulk updates are painful when sizing and font changes needed.","The user finds Miro unique in its ability to enable rapid diagram creation in real-time, while others can observe or contribute. They appreciate the ease of use and the ability to create great-looking diagrams. However, they find the licensing model to be slightly annoying and would prefer a more fair and value-oriented arrangement."
figma,G2,"User: I first came across it during an online course and fell in love with it! So I adopted it for my teams working from home. Now we are pretty much back in the office but its still my go to. We all sit around a massive table to collab and ideate and its all captured in real time on the board. I find it really aesthetically pleasing, which helps. and whatever I need, there is a template for it or something that can be tweaked.
User: The infinity of the boards is excellent - the templates, tools, colours, simplicity of navigation and its super intuitive so you don't have to learn loads of new stuff to use it! I love you can bring people to you - I love the tutorials. I love Miroverses....
User: When I have invited people to join my team, they inevitably love it and go off to create their own, which results in one of my boards being disabled to its a bit of a faff to sling them out of my team, copy the content to a new board and then get my board back. 
Also I really struggle with the % zoom. My boards have been built at 1% so when I copy and paste something in, its always so tiny that I have to locate a spec, and zoom in to highlight this to drag and enlarge. Its a massive pain! I dont know how to fix this now.","The user finds the Enterprise team management feature in Miro very helpful for understanding the challenges and benefits of Continuous Improvement Initiatives, such as real-time collaboration and avoiding business travel for workshops and meetings. They also mention that it could be more intuitive for early adopters."
figma,G2,"User: It supports projects discussions to discuss problems to be addressed. E.g. I attach a P&ID and we have a full visualization of the process that the team can discuss and genetrate ideas, looking to the equipment, etc 
It is also applied by me to generate vision/mission of our department or brainstorm issues the team is facing. I apply always as a idea collection tool 
I also apply as a tool for trainings, it changes a little the ppt convencional visualization
User: The flexibility of the tool. 
I like I can apply tables with post-its inside (structure + brainstorming). 
Also like I can include documents/ ppt presentations and be able to brainstorm with teams, collect ideas and train using the Miro tools. 
Also are very good the templates avaible that I can have new ideas on how to structure and conduct workshops and perform idea generation workshops.
User: Loading time of the content sometimes is a little slow for the quantity of information and drawings attached to the board. 
Lagging (delay to move) when there are too much people connected and doing an activity (more than 20 for example). I am not sure if this is something related to quantity of people or net connection issues, but generates some lagging that people get¬¥s frustated.","The user primarily uses Miro for various user research analysis tasks and finds the sticky notes, voting, and background music features helpful during workshops. They appreciate the built-in templates for efficiency but suggest providing more file export formats."
figma,G2,"User: It's helping us to work in hybrid envrionments and enables workshops to go ahead without everyone being physically present. Furthermore, we can make collaborative decisions more easily in innovation settings.
User: It's easy to learn and use for my colleagues and clients - frequently they can get started without any real training. I also like that it helps me think through problems easily without the bounds of paper and space.......it's available everywhere I have an internet connection.
User: I find that sharing with non -members could be easier. I also find the templates are harder to customise for your needs and that takes more time than it should.","The user prefers Miro over competitors due to its freeform tools, customization, and collaboration features. However, they face issues with text box limits, lack of automatic spell correction, and frequent new feature/update pop-ups."
figma,G2,"User: I am working on a large project across multiple teams in different locations. Miro has helped us collaborate and work jointly on material that otherwise would have been more challenging to do in other tools. This is a quick, real time way of working with others, even when you're not in the same room.
User: Miro is a fantastic tool that has been invaluable in helping my remote team collaborate and flesh out ideas. It's a great help when running workshops to hold content and allow all attendees to add in material and notes.
User: There can be a tendency from time to time to accidentally move windows/boxes on the whiteboards, particularly when working with colleagues that have less experience with Miro. However, this can be remedied with a quick CTRL Z or locking the windows.","Users find Figma helpful for creating real-time diagrams and collaborating with team members, but struggle with creating sequence diagrams and using templates, as most are paid."
figma,G2,"User: Miro helps me create a mindmap for a product, share it with clients and other stakeholders, get feedback, and work collaboratively. Miro also allows me to make the initial sketch for a product to give the clients a basic flow of the product so we can solve the problems before the development and keep the product consistent; this also helps in efficiency and reducing costs.
User: The upside of Miro is brainstorming can be done collaboratively with all the stakeholders, including clients; this helps in coming up with solutions quickly and even testing out the ideas in the initial stages of development.
User: Miro is a good app overall, but it can sometimes be overwhelming and cluttered. Miro cannot be used offline. Navigating on a larger gets a little tedious and occasionally inaccurate. lags at times.","Users appreciate Miro's collaborative features for gaining consensus among product team members and its ability to replace conference room whiteboards. However, they face challenges with importing Excel tables and HTML content and desire more robust editing options for post-it note styles."
figma,G2,"User: It's making remote collaboration easier. The infinite canvas solves the problem of having to fit ideas onto a ppt slide - it's great to have as much space as I want.
User: The infinite canvas, how easy it is to collaborate, delightful design. Creating mindmaps, connecting shapes are super intuitive.
User: Powerpoint - Miro handshake. We (unfortunately) still use ppt a lot in our company, and it doesn't always work to copy a miro 'image' onto a ppt slide, so I have to create a slide from scratch.","Users appreciate Miro's collaboration features and customization options, which enable effective teamwork regardless of location. However, the contract terms limit the number of people and days for multiple sessions, making it less effective for their company's needs."
figma,G2,"User: It helps me bring together disparate pieces of information into a central repository of information - single source of truth.
User: Unlimited board size is a big positive for me. So many other applications simply grind to halt, under the weight of extensive UX research artifacts
User: Perhaps my biggest gripe would be the inability to import documents previously created in Lucid chart.","Users appreciate Figma for its ability to facilitate collaboration across different locations and timezones, and its usefulness in project management, research synthesis, and remote workshops. However, some users find the UI to be cluttered with controls in all four corners of the screen."
figma,G2,"User: All our team can access the boards either independently or together. 
This enables everyone to work on items when it is best for them. 
 
Having everyone able to provide input or comments directly in the Miro boards means that there is less indirect / administrative load.
User: Great compatibility with other programs. Microsoft Teams and Office tie ins work well. 
Duplicated (copied in) data means no location links to maintain. 
Large number of templates that can be leveraged to kick start your layouts.
User: Sometimes you want to preserve links to the data and be able to automatically update. 
This is not a strength of the platform as generally speaking the data become separate from the source when pulled in.","The user appreciates the ability to organize their project in one place and share it with collaborators, as well as the ability to add comments and sticky notes. They also appreciate the endless board feature and the ability to follow themselves around the board for critiques. The user finds the platform easy to use and appreciates the hidden features."
figma,G2,"User: Effective and collaborative retrospectives can be hard to manage with certain tools. Miro makes this whole world very simple and implementing fun and informative health checks has become a breeze.
User: Everything, honestly this tool is my presentation and collaboration go to. It's helped me become a better engineering manager and connect tools I use everyday to a wider use group.
User: Literally nothing. With all the new features coming shortly it'll be hard to fault or find a better replacement. However, some users may find Miro's interface overwhelming at first or may experience slow loading times when working with large boards.","The user finds that remote workshops are more effective than in-person workshops due to the ability to use the same documentation and interface. They also appreciate the intuitive nature of the tool, which allows them to get tangible results within 60 minutes."
figma,G2,"User: It solves the issue of having alignment moments with the client as they can work with you. The team has a single source of truth and that really helps move the project forward.
User: The app is updated often. New features are added that really help me get the most out of Miro. It's such a nice way of interacting with clients instead of presenting.
User: Sometimes the loading of the boards takes a while. It would be awesome if this could be done quicker, but then again we create some large boards. Other than that, no issues.",User appreciates the ability to share ideas and plans with others and the ease of tracking and moving things around. They find their sheets limited due to their organization's restrictions.
figma,G2,"User: The main problem it is solving for me and the team/company, is that it allows some processes and collaborative tasks to be done much simpler and online. 
 
Processes that are sometimes difficult to visualize in a meeting can usually be created in MIRO. With your own creativity being the limitation. Besides that it is great to improve interactiveness. By having team members actively write and move things on the board it creates a much more active session
User: Quite easy to understand, very easy to collaborate with team members. And the creative potential is very high compared to a lot of other collaboration platforms.
User: I wish it had even more templates. Especially templates that stand in relation with AGILE workflows and ways of working. E.a. to support SCRUM refinements, SCRUM reviews etc. 
Also a wide variety of templates for Roadmaps in all shapes and sizes could be great, as this is what it is used a lot for.","Users appreciate Figma's ease of collaboration for projects with multiple people in different locations, saving time on gathering and developing ideas. However, they find some settings, such as navigation, difficult to locate and suggest improving the setup for collaboration, tracking new ideas, and creating a master file for better organization."
figma,G2,"User: Helping with our discovery process for opportunity solutions trees, for roadmap and timelines, for anything really
User: I love that there's ""infinite space"" , if you prep a presentation on ppt for example, you're limited to slides but with Miro the sky is the limit
User: We have a business account and sometimes colleagues from other departments are part of a different account and we can't give them editing rights to the boards","Users appreciate Miro's central dashboard for team access and scheduling location visits, as well as its ability to create transparent boards for team collaboration. However, they find it overwhelming initially until boards are organized and easily accessible."
figma,G2,"User: visualize and communicate plans, collaborate and facilitate workshops, keep participants engaged.
User: simple, easy to use collaboration too. you can invite as many guests to the board during virtual workshops and meetings.
User: export content from Miro to powerpoint for presentation"," Users find Figma great for collaboration and data visualization, especially for large teams and presenting processes and strategies. However, they suggest that additional pricing structures should be available, as the current ones are cost-prohibitive for casual users."
figma,G2,"User: I used beforehand powerpoints or virtuals whiteboards but i was always limited by the format. With MIRO, there are no restrictions and i can add as much as informaion i want as i move forward with my thinking and projects.
User: I love using Miro to map projects at the discovery phase, to create diagrams, mindmaps and put together all information gathered to kick off a project. 
More possibilities than Visio.
User: Spend too much time formating diagrams. Templates never work for me and i find them not easy to adapt.","User appreciates the ease of use and capability of Miro, but is not sure if it's great for their specific use."
figma,G2,"User: Helps with gathering all the project's info in a single place. 
Helps with remote, real-time work
User: Constant improvements that help work better both together and alone. 
The templates and Miroverse are great resources to help kick off projects.
User: Would be great to have more insight tools. a way to summerize all the visual data. there are improvements in that area with regard to sticky notes, but it's still in beta. and also not relevant to other visual aids.","Users appreciate Figma for its ability to facilitate collaboration among distributed teams and its variety of templates for product management. However, they find it less convenient for outlining and navigating work compared to products like Mural."
figma,G2,"User: Product Development with team members
User: It's fun to use with many templates, stickers, widgets etc. 
And the best part - it has both web and desktop versions!
User: If possible, to have a more pleasing user interface.","Users appreciate Miro's endless space and easy collaboration features, making it an intuitive and visual platform for various tasks. However, they face difficulties with loading times when boards have many images and elements, suggesting a need for improved performance to support extensive collaboration."
figma,G2,"User: Drive the discussion with the stakeholders along the different designs, journeys and the overall experience of our game at the same time with multiple people. Specially having a clear idea from an end-to-end experience.
User: The flexibility that I do have depending on the specific needs for each ideation/brainstorm. 
 
It is really quick (to define and design). Mainly about resizing and copypasting. 
 
Create UX flows there is really smooth.
User: Sometimes it takes too long to load and even may crash if you do have a screen full of wireframes. 
 
I might expect different post-its forms/sizes (this is the main thing that I use).","Users find Miro helpful for visualizing solutions, diagramming implementation processes, and facilitating collaboration in various business aspects. It offers an intuitive drag-and-drop design with pre-designed templates, making it easy to use. However, some users find the scroll methodology challenging initially, affecting usability perception until they become familiar with the navigation."
figma,G2,"User: Provides an alternative to project stakeholders who would normally sift through various Excel and Word docs for project onboarding and collaboration. 
 
Makes it easy to gain measurable feedback (votes and post-it notes) quickly. Makes remote working incredibly easy.
User: Providing a central source of truth with various mediums to share information and bringing stakeholders up-to-speed. 
 
Excellent for project collaboration, feedback sessions and brainstorming. 
 
Love being able to easily add images, texts, slides and post-it notes. 
 
Great templates!
User: Sometimes hard to navigate around boards. Functions can be glitchy at times. 
 
When inviting new users to group sessions, they can be overwhelmed by the range of functions.","Users appreciate Figma's virtual collaboration features, templates, and versatility for meetings, trainings, and idea sharing. However, they find navigation and privacy settings challenging, especially when securing sensitive boards or spaces."
figma,G2,"User: It allows me to collaborate easily with other team members for user research or brainstorming. Other tools like Figma do that, too, but people are uncomfortable using those tools because they are complex or not flexible enough to match the need of the hour.
User: Allows me to share boards with people even if they don't have a Miro account and an app installed. People can see each other's cursor. Scroll and Zoom is very smooth. It doesn't have any fixed ways to use it. I can use it any way I want.
User: Icons which are available with the Wireframe library are minimal. I like the IconFinder as an alternative, but it doesn't allow me to change colours easily. It also has issues with writing notes. It doesn't fix spelling mistakes while writing notes. Sometimes it causes a lot of trouble to handle layer ordering. If I want to move one layer in front/back of the other, it takes a lot of effort.","The user appreciates Figma's FigJam as a virtual whiteboard for sharing team ideas with a wider audience, highlighting its fast, snappy, and easy setup. They also mention its simplicity and ease of sharing with new users. However, they note the recent restrictions on the free tier and limitations in shapes and formatting options."
figma,G2,"User: It generates great value for me in the team resolution of complex problems. 
It also helps me to promote the participation of my entire team regardless of whether they are extroverts or introverts, which greatly enriches the analysis. 
It also helps me to organize, show, store and share knowledge.
User: It has more that you can get with the conventional blackboard. You can use it not only in remote work but also projecting in meeting rooms making the tool an unlimited whiteboard for interaction, organization, editing, distribution and all the advantages of a digital tool without losing the benefits of face-to-face meetings. Increases the desire to collaborate, create and design.
User: Some dinosaur users are reluctant to use it, but once they learn it, they love it. You just have to break through that first resistance. 
The other thing that I don't like is that you can not freeze the first row and column view to be able to work on large tables like in excel.","Users appreciate Miro's accessibility, ease of use, and real-time collaboration features for remote teams, making it an essential tool for visual thinkers. However, they wish for better interoperability with Excel, data visualization capabilities, vector symbol creation, custom fonts, and more features catering to printed media, such as paragraph styles and formatting templates."
figma,G2,"User: Ability to track changes and revert them by just looking through history. 
Has great inbuilt features for brainstorming and workshops sessions such as voting, commenting etc. 
Excellent and responsive customer support team.
User: I like how it is very easy to collaborate and brainstorm ideas with other colleagues. 
The ability to allow hybrid or fully remote teams to easily and effectively collaborate. It makes engagement and team collaboration easy. 
Friendly user interface. 
It is cost effective. 
Supports multiple languages. 
Easy to implement and set up. 
Availability of customer support team. 
It is available in many countries. 
Seamless integrations with other third-party tools.
User: Very accessible and very easy to use. 
It is a comprehensive team collaboration tool. 
It makes collaboration and engagement easy.","Users appreciate Miro for its collaborative features and visual aspects, allowing them to create mood boards, project outlines, and design process maps. However, they experience slow performance, possibly due to uploading larger images."
figma,G2,"User: We work in a way that encourages loads of idea sharing and being able to jot ideas down on post-its and then move them around and have the board evolve as our ideas do, makes the process collaborative and creative even when we are not all in the same room.
User: I love that we are able to collaborate in a creative, playful way even when we are not physically in the same room. Having the option to create individual workspaces on the same board and then come together to review each other's ideas works so well for my team.
User: I'd love to see more colours available in the post-its - sometimes we run out of unique colours and that restricts our ability to theme information.","Users appreciate Figma for its collaboration tools and auto-layout feature, which simplifies the design process and effectively implements flexbox. However, they find the image manipulation tools lacking, particularly in setting focal points and background positions. Some users are also concerned about the recent acquisition by Adobe."
figma,G2,"User: Storing large amounts of information. Collaborating with clients. Better than Post-its because it saves the information for later use. Remote work is easier. Templates are useful
User: Miro is versatile and very easy to use. I like to explore the templates in the Miraverse. I now use it almost every day, not only with my team but also to store my notes on various topics.
User: It takes time to get practice zooming in and out, as it is a large board. It is sometimes too responsive and the board moves around very quickly. I also feel dizzy looking at it when a teammate moves around the board","Users find Figma helpful for facilitating hybrid/remote meetings, brainstorming sessions, and personal mind mapping due to its intuitive and handy tools, visual templates, and centralized organization. However, they mention a limitation of three boards for free accounts."
figma,G2,"User: I actually use Figma anytime I want to edit anything. I used it for UX/UI schooling but now I work as a graphic designer and drafter where I constantly find myself pulling things into Figma for editing and finishing touches before I send it out.
User: Once you learn the different hot keys and shortcuts, you will be on your way to becoming a master at Figma! I love Figma because I can get things done quickly. Not just quickly but also your design be exactly what you want it to be. I also love the prototyping and smart animate is a life saver. And having an amazing community to be able to utilize.
User: When using the resize option, (Ctrl-K), the design options on the side toolbar go away. Which is fine and makes sense, I think. But often times I forget I'm on resize and am lost trying to figure out why everything is gone. But honestly at this point I know why and then just go back to selector mode.","The architect user appreciates Miro for enabling idea sharing and innovation in large team sessions through whiteboard drawings and easy authentication and content sharing. However, they mention the cost might be a concern for small teams and experience lagging with large boards."
figma,G2,"User: Lack of collaboration: Miro allows team members to collaborate and work together on projects, regardless of their location. This helps to improve communication and break down silos. 
 
Inefficient meetings: With Miro, teams can conduct effective and efficient meetings. Miro's digital whiteboard allows teams to capture ideas, organize information, and make decisions in real-time.
User: Easy to work with. 
It can be used as a repository. 
A tremendous collaborative tool with tool ready to use templates 
the zoom in zoom out feature is best with quick sync
User: At times takes 30second and more for sync when multiple people are using it 
Needs high-speed internet for usage, best usage at the office, but would be challenged to use from mobile internet","Users find Miro helpful for brainstorming, process mapping, and collaboration during team meetings due to its user-friendly interface. However, they experience difficulties with the payment process, particularly for team administrators."
figma,G2,"User: Miro allows us to cross collaborate across teams specifically for storyboard direction. It's a starting place for ideas for many teams that can be also used as documentation to brief designers.
User: I love how easy it is to collaborate and brainstorm ideas
User: I find that boards with a lot of content can be quite slow","User praises Miro for its ability to recreate the whiteboard experience in a digital space, enhancing the experience and making it better. They also mention the lack of functionality, such as the ability to hide sticky notes and highlight participants' objects."
figma,G2,"User: We are all remote, so having a tool such as this is very helpful. Plus even prior to being remote, enough with wasting paper already!
User: I am fascinated by how easy it is to use considering how many features it has, tables, notes etc
User: Nothing so far, can't complain really...","The user appreciates the ease of use, versatility, and flexibility of Miro, which has helped them shift their problem-solving methodology from pen and paper to visual abstracting. They also wish for better tools for creating, modifying, and importing vector graphics."
figma,G2,"User: Miro makes collaboration easy 
Easy to share ideas within the team 
Helps to gather feedback 
Help to present different ideas 
Great templates to choose from so no need to reinvent the weels
User: Easy to collaborate with a broader team.

User: For people who have not yet used an online whiteboarding tool, the navigation and basic features might take a bit of getting used to. However, this can be overcome with some basic training or youtube videos.","Users appreciate Miro's continuous development of new features, such as tags, sentiment-based clusters, and Miro AI, which help in organizing qualitative data for UX researchers. They enjoy the simple and intuitive interface, allowing for easy creation and organization of data from workshops. However, limitations in typography options hinder users from creating presentations that align with their company's identity, causing them to switch to other platforms."
figma,G2,"User: Miro reduces boring presentation slides where the user only listens to the presenter talk. Miro allows engagement and input from other users. This makes meetings much more productive.
User: I love that Miro has an extensive collection of templates that make creating boards for meetings and discussions easy. Miro also makes collaboration and team engagement easy. I can give all my team members access to my board right before the meeting and allow engagement.

The flexibility allows collaborative input, effort, etc. on processes we are not aware of.
User: Accessible and easy to use. Easy for collaboration. 
Can track changes and revert changes by looking through history. 
Many pathways to build a project from start to finish and a way to organize strategy.
User: Large Miro board(s) may take time to load. Slow page upload would display a blurry board. 
Comments are timestamped and call callout stakeholders. 
Some setup are not locked, so some users may unintentionally move the setup.","Users appreciate Figma's collaborative platform, which allows teams to work on ideas creatively and efficiently without needing to be present simultaneously. They particularly enjoy the group collaboration features and the visual aspect of the tool. However, some users find navigating the boards to be slightly challenging and require a mindset adjustment."
figma,G2,"User: As a globally distributed team, we are inherently remote and sit in different time zones. Miro is helping us collaborate more effectively and efficiently, allowing us to gather multiple stakeholders' perspectives from numerous regions. This, in turn, helps us make better-informed decisions.
User: Miro is a one-stop, do it all digital whiteboarding tool that enables and empowers teams to collaborate better in person, remotely, and asynchronously. It has great built-in features for workshops and brainstorming sessions, such as setting a timer, voting and commenting.
User: The only thing that can get a little confusing are the access permissions for each team within an organisation","Users appreciate Figma's easy-to-use platform for online meetings and collaboration, offering endless space and compatibility with various media. However, they express frustration with the learning curve and some unresponsive functions, as well as the lack of tooltips on the toolbar."
figma,G2,"User: Helps structuring ideas, formulating new roadmaps & brainstorming.
User: Infinite canvas, voting, stickers and rich diagramming tools. Multiple app integration allow to use miro as the primary productivity tool.
User: It could take a toll on your browser, so use something like edge browser which can sleep tabs when not in use. The other thing is there is no private space even with miro enterprise where i only wish to keep documents for myself.","The user appreciates the strategic online tool Miro, which has been a game changer for their workshops, allowing everyone to interact, play, and learn. They also suggest improving the PDF export capabilities and adding more fonts to the limited options available."
figma,G2,"User: Miro offers a tool that is quick to use for unlimited ideation and collaboration using stickies and images. The offer nice starter templates and a community developed template space.
User: I like best ability to place visuals, stickies and info on large whiteboard for ideating.
User: Less users on my teams are willing to adopt the tool. Likely new tool overload.","The user praises Miro for its ease of use, collaboration features, and visual representation of thoughts, ideas, and flows, as well as its efficiency in asynchronous collaboration. They suggest improving the ""table"" feature by adding formatting, copy/paste from Google Sheets or Excel, and creating duplicate cells/content."
figma,G2,"User: Visual interpretation of anything is easy to consume. PPTs / word documents are great as long as you attach a visual map to it either through description OR through plpatforms like Miro ( latter is much less effort for a lot of reward )
User: Collaboration and ease of use. Can't explain how many meetings I have succeeded in because of Miro
User: It can be too much for someone who is not ready to put in that little bit of effort. 
 
I am used to it now but did take time for me to get here","Users find Miro helpful in solving IT architectural problems through diagramming and collaboration, making it a game changer for their team. They appreciate the ease of sharing boards, but face challenges with versioning and maintaining diagrams over time."
figma,G2,"User: Being able to solidify abstract thoughts and conversations into a cohesive solution. It allows us to see the mess and confusion among our teams and then move toward cohesion and clear direction.
User: Miro allows me to work abstractly and keeping better track of that work. PPT does okay with conceptualizing, but it can only do so much. Miro lets me think more clearly, create integrations, and bring other people along on the journey all the while offering a great interface.
User: There are almost too many options. The templates help with this quite a bit, but deciding on the right approach with so much white space and possibilities can be hard.","Users appreciate Figma's ability to facilitate collaboration and alignment in meetings, especially its flexibility in designing boards for various scenarios and allowing guest editors. However, they dislike occasional bugs and issues with integrated apps like planning poker, as well as some format constraints."
figma,G2,"User: I use Miro mainly for workshoppign internally or with clients. I use the consulting plan to balance cost with flexibility and confidentiality. I often use miro even during face to face workshops to capture the productions in real time.
User: Overall an excellent choice for facilitating collaboration during workshops and team-based activities. Its real-time collaboration capabilities enable users to work together seamlessly, whether in-person or remote, fostering a more interactive and productive workshop experience. The wide range of tools and templates, such as mind maps and Kanban boards, caters to various use cases, making it easy to adapt the platform for different activities. Furthermore, Miro's integration with rich media such as videos and PDF ensures effortless sharing and access to work across platforms, streamlining team collaboration.
User: Performance issues can arise when working with large boards or a high number of simultaneous users, which may result in lag or slow loading times. Additionally, the platform's customization options can sometimes feel restrictive, especially when users require more flexibility in tailoring Miro to their specific needs.","The user appreciates Figma's flexibility and ease of use for conveying ideas and concepts, as it caters to visual learners. However, they experience long loading times when opening the app, which can be inconvenient during short meetings."
figma,G2,"User: Almost my entire team works remotely, so this is the best way for us to interract to each other and compose a valuable solution collecting comments and feedback.
User: Usually my team and I use Miro for: workshops, presentations, design critique, design reviews, create pdf documentation, generate image and collect feedback.
User: What we really struggle doing is a line. The ""line"" tool behaves as a connection flow. Sometimes it is had to use because it stucks with objects. How be great to have a line that behaves as a shape.","Users appreciate Figma's collaboration features, zoom capabilities, and the ability to follow along with others and leave comments on specific areas. However, they suggest improvements in the drawover functionality, as it can be difficult to use and move around."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is our go-to tool for PI Planning and any other team collaborative events.
User: Ability to have everyone contributing together at the same time is great. Helps us feel less separate from one another.
User: Some of the formatting options are cumbersome. Difficult to size things uniformly and tables are hard to work with.","Users appreciate Figma's collaborative space for design teams, finding it easy to use for brainstorming sessions and sharing work. They suggest making stickies more dynamic but have no major issues."
figma,G2,"User: Planning of projects/programs (both short (weeks/months) and long (3+ years). Its interface also makes it very easy to generate flowcharts and mindmaps to identify and clearly document dependencies and sequence of deliverables.
User: How user-friendly it is. I have used other programs in the past (MS Project, Visio, etc.) but the interface of Miro is far beyond other tools. The forums and FAQ websites are also very useful. I have been able to answer most of my questions by looking things up on the forums.
User: Some of the features could be improved. For instance, enabling compatibility with Microsoft Excell, and being able to lock rows and columns in tables (this can be solved with the Kanban for rows but not columns)","Users appreciate FigJam for enabling remote collaboration on brand strategies and virtual whiteboard sessions, allowing teams to brainstorm, take notes, and refine ideas. However, they note that it has a slight learning curve and moving text with stickers or highlights can be challenging."
figma,G2,"User: Miro helps with sync and async collaboration. It helps me to facilitate workshops, jot down ideas, and visually represent/mock concepts.
User: It has many useful features like templates, clustering, and the timer.
User: It's the small things that are frustrating. For example, when clustering, it automatically sorts the sticky notes in some fashion, not sure what the logic is, instead of keeping it grouped in the same area as it originally lays.","User finds Figma easy to use and flexible for various tasks, but recently experienced slow loading times, taking 2-4 minutes to load, compared to no issues last month."
figma,G2,"User: The retrospectives for the scrum teams. 
Discuss strategies for the managers and set different action items.
User: This tool is very colaborate. 
The interface has different options for sharing opinions in a group. 
A free layer is an excellent option when just a few members.
User: Only just has three boards. 
Some components or options need to pay for use.","The user highly recommends FigJam for its simplicity, ease of use, and flexibility in creating and sharing complex systems, marketing programs, and design mock-ups. They appreciate the endless canvas, which helps combat confusion and anxiety around building complex marketing campaigns. FigJam has become one of their most valuable tools after two decades of experience with similar apps."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is allowing a group of remote workers to effectively collaborate as if they were in the same conference room. In addition, the graphics and ease of use of miro are much more powerful than tools such as Visio and PowerPoint.
User: User interface - very easy to learn and use. Breadth of templates available both from miro and the user community. Collaboration capabilities. Tracking of changes.
User: There are some shapes that would be beneficial to have as part of the default package. One particular one is for Value Stream Mapping. There is an issue in the miro community that was closed, but didn't resolve the issue identified.","Users appreciate Figma's seamless collaboration, large collection readability, and easy exporting to PPT. They also like its browser compatibility, various templates, and dot voting function on sticky notes. However, they suggest improving the board favoriting feature by making it more accessible and adding a ChatGPT plug-in to help rewrite sticky notes into more powerful texts."
figma,G2,"User: I primarily use it for early creative processes, to allow back and forth work with teams on the other side of the planet. There are also language difficulties, so a visual tool is ideal. For me personally, it's about developing characters and storylines with cross-disciplinary teams.
User: It is stable and allows for quick whiteboarding of ideas and back and forth iterations quickly.
User: Notes aren't ideal; hard to notice them and to go back and view old notes and their resolutions. Google Docs has a better system. Also, the restrictions on the unpaid version can make collaboration very difficult, especially in a large organization. Last issue is security, and protecting IP.","The user appreciates the asynchronous communication and platform's ability to replace a whiteboard during ideation, but finds the lack of meaningful integration with Zoom or Teams chats to be a drawback."
figma,G2,"User: I work in a consulting company where whiteboarding is a core component of our Problem Solving and collaborative approach. with Covid Miro became out go-to platform
User: - Use case within collaborative workshops (templates, breakouts with music, bringing people with you) 
- it's very user friendly and easy to use allowing new joiners to be part of the solution quickly
User: - I work across a series of programs and sometimes when I do work cross-softwares (e.g., copying things from other tools) it doesn't work great 
- When we work with members outside our organization it is somewhat limiting (though I am not sure if this is driven by our own security)","Users appreciate Miro for its ease of use and collaboration features, especially the Microsoft Teams integration, which allows seamless sharing and editing access to boards. They also like the single sign-on option and the ability to upload real-life sticky notes as Miro stickies. However, some users face frustrations with company-imposed restrictions on access and board deletion."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam allows me and my team to quickly and easily make low-fidelity wireframes and conceptual designs as well as collect our findings from our user interviews and other Discovery activities.
User: I love the ability to ideate and diagram in FigJam and then copy it to Figma to use as a reference and modify as necessary. It's really great to use them in tandem. I also find the shapes and arrows easy to use and connect. The stickers are a fun feature as well. 
 
The audio chat in Figjam and Figma is clutch. My team will typically meet in there instead of scheduling a Teams meeting. It's a great way to hop on review a design or ask questions about a specific thing. 
 
I also really like the option to give anyone access for 24 hours. This is great for collaborating with people that are not within the company.
User: There's nothing I don't like about FigJam. I don't feel like there is anything missing from the application.","Users appreciate Figma for enabling remote ideation sessions and asynchronous collaboration. They like the infinite space, autosave, PDF export, and its intuitiveness for occasional participants. However, they face issues with limited text box characters, undo functionality, presentation uploads losing resolution, lack of GIF support, inability to upload videos directly, and incompatibility with Visio maps."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is enabling a platform in which multiple users can consume content (created by teams) and contribute. 
I like all the features built to make that collaboration more efficient
User: I like the real time collaboration capabilities (value), I like the community aspect of Miro (e.g. free templates that speed up your work), I like the easiness and simplicity of the tool (usability)
User: I have mixed feelings about being a one-stop shop for everything a designer needs 
(PowerPoint, digital, whiteboard, design capabilities) and the fact the miro is not excelling in any of the areas. 
The highest benefit from the value proposition is the light-way collaboration aspect and how the tool is optimized for that (everyone can use it) 
At the same time, I appreciate some design capabilities, so I don't need to be jumping from tool to tool until all the concept is ready to be ""migrated"" to an execution tool (like Figma)","Users appreciate FigJam for hosting virtual design sprints and facilitating workshops, with diverse options for color schemes and fonts, and auto-naming sticky notes. However, they find some templates ordinary and wish for more robust voting capabilities."
figma,G2,"User: Helps us from paper waste and time.
User: Real-Time collaboration. Able to work remotely and get work done on the fly.
User: When using the app on my phone it's a little slow. On the desktop, it takes a while to load content on boards.","Users appreciate Figma for its ability to improve visibility, centralize stakeholder feedback, and provide a source of truth for designs, user flows, and wireframes. They find capturing feedback and editing text content on FigJam easy and enjoy using Figma design system components within FigJam. However, they suggest automatic updates for modified Figma designs on FigJam boards, as manual copy-pasting is currently required."
figma,G2,"User: Those listed within the last questions. And we are find more daily
User: Easy to use. Flexible use for Jira, mapping, retro's, fun stuff with teams
User: Slow to load lately; not sure why. Last month we had zero issues with the product. Takes a long time 2-4 min to load","Users appreciate FigJam for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of collaboration with remote teams and stakeholders. They find it useful for various tasks, including workflow diagramming and product vision workshops. However, they suggest improvements such as extending the 24-hour timer for non-authenticated users and adding a vertical alignment option for text within shapes."
figma,G2,"User: Miro allows us to work on projects concurrently with multiple users. Collaboration sessions don't usually require users to take away update tasks. The document gets updated during the collaboration session.
User: I started using Miro when COVID hit, and we started working from home. We originally started using it as a simple whiteboard replacement. As we became more familiar with the tool, we saw its power as more than a whiteboard replacement.
User: Miro is very comprehensive. The comprehensiveness leads to frequent software updates. It becomes a little irritating that whenever you open the software, it prompts you to restart to download the updates.","Users appreciate Miro's collaborative capabilities and initially used it as a whiteboard replacement during remote work. However, they find the frequent software updates irritating and disruptive to their workflow."
figma,G2,"User: Being able to run ideation sessions with people working remote. Also to gather information in one place for collaboration asynchronous.
User: Infinity space, autosafe, I can save in pdf to share final product with non Miro Users. Intuitive for ocassional participants. More and better features than Whiteboard.
User: Limited caracters in a text box. When undo it does for a big chunk of work. when upload presentations look and feel is affected and loose resolution. Wish gifs are included. Can't upload videos, just links to videos. Doesn't allow to upload Visio maps","Users appreciate Figjam for its ease of use, templates, and integration with Figma, making it a convenient collaboration tool for both designers and non-designers. However, they find its customization options limited, particularly regarding shapes, colors, and fonts, and wish for more detailed wireframing capabilities. This sometimes leads to a tedious process of creating shapes in Figma and pasting them into Figjam."
figma,G2,"User: Collaborating can be challenging while working remotely, but Miro makes it much easier to share ideas, ideate, brainstorm, and create something together. I use it every day to keep track of my tasks and to create conceptual designs before I work in Figma.
User: I like the ease of use with Miro. It's possible to collaborate with colleagues quickly. My favorite feature is the Microsoft Teams integration. With Miro and other whiteboarding tools, we always had issues trying to share editing access on boards, but now that we can embed the boards in Teams, anyone on the call can have access and edit the board, even if they aren't an employee at our company. It honestly has been a game changer for us when we do workshops or user interviews. I also like the single sign on option. It makes getting into Miro much easier and I don't have to enter my password. 
 
I also love that you can take pictures of sticky notes in real life and upload them to Miro and they will turn into Miro stickies. If the handwriting is hard to read, then it might need to be corrected, but this is still a cool feature.
User: There's not much I don't like about Miro. My main frustration is that our company restricts our access and licenses to 30-60 days and deletes our boards after 90 days of inactivity, but I don't think that's a Miro policy, just our company. I do like the fact that you can download a file of the board and reupload it in case any boards get deleted.","Users appreciate Figma for reducing paper waste and saving time, as well as enabling real-time collaboration for remote work. However, they experience slow performance on mobile devices and slow loading times on desktop boards."
figma,G2,"User: Asynchronous communication and to bring together parties from across North America.
User: The ability to use the platform as a means to replace a classic white board during ideation.
User: Lack of meaningful integration with Zoom or Teams chats to tie together a conversation thats occurring and the subject matter on the board.","Users appreciate Miro's real-time collaboration features, community aspect, and ease of use. However, they have mixed feelings about it being a one-stop shop for designers, as it doesn't excel in any specific area. They value its lightweight collaboration aspect and some design capabilities, but still need to use execution tools like Figma."
figma,G2,"User: Keeping large collections readible and digestable 
seemless working together 
exporting larger screens towards PPT
User: * works very well in the browser 
* no special App needed 
* many different templates - but using it blank also works very fast 
* dot voting function on sticky notes
User: * Favouriting (starring) a board is 'hidden' one level to deep. I would expect the star function next to the board name. 
* ChatGPT plug-in to rewrite sticy notes into more powerfull texts (provide some options for users to select from); not everyone is a good writer ;)","The user appreciates FigJam for its ease in creating low-fidelity wireframes and conceptual designs, as well as collecting findings from user interviews. They enjoy using FigJam in tandem with Figma, and find the shapes, arrows, and stickers easy to use. The audio chat feature is highly valued for team collaboration, and the 24-hour access option is appreciated for working with external collaborators. The user has no complaints or suggestions for improvement."
figma,G2,"User: It's solving the problem of not being in the same room and is helping us solve the issue with misalignment, by providing a visual way to collaborate and align together in meetings.
User: The collaborative aspect and use case of Miro is great! I love how much flexibility you have with designing boards for various different scenarios! I love that you can have guest editors for boards without spending more.
User: I dislike that it can be buggy sometimes, we do run into issues where integrated apps like planning poker, causes issues. I also don't like some of the format constraints with Miro.","Users appreciate Figjam for its ease of collaboration with non-professionals, communication with product managers, and compatibility with Figma. They also enjoy the small widgets and meeting structure ideas provided. However, they suggest improvements such as background color customization, better connector line alignment, thumbnail setup, and more widgets."
figma,G2,"User: Miro helps us solve IT architectural problems by diagramming and then showing to different functional areas and users. We didn't have a collaboration tool before this so it's really been a game changer.
User: I like that collaborating and sharing boards with people is really easy. It's straightforward to spin up a new board and begin working.
User: Versioning boards and maintaining them overtime can be a challenge. Often times we'll make diagrams and then they're no longer valid a few months later, and people will bring them up.","Users find FigJam to be a valuable tool for their research process, as it enables easy collaboration with stakeholders and efficient execution of tasks like affinity diagramming. However, they face issues with formatting, such as difficulty pasting Excel rows and editing text through multiple layers. Resizing elements can also be problematic."
figma,G2,"User: I'm involved in many planning sessions across all of our verticals and teams. Miro has been instrumental in collaborating across teams, and aligning everyone on the goal, outcome, and next steps.
User: Easy to use visual representation of thoughts, ideas, and flows. The basics are easy to pick up for a new user, and more advanced users can tap into many ""hidden"" features. It's made async collaboration extremely efficient.
User: I think the ""table"" feature can use major improvements. Formatting, copy/paste from google sheets or excel, and creating duplicate cells/content can be improved.","The user works in a consulting company and uses Miro for collaborative workshops due to its user-friendly interface and ease of use for new joiners. However, they face challenges when working with other software and collaborating with external members, which may be due to their organization's security settings."
figma,G2,"User: Customer Journey Maps, Workshops, Brainstorming, Client Deliverables, Team Best Practices
User: Miro has been a strategic online tool since the pandemic, and it's a significant game changer with our workshops, allowing everyone to interact, play and learn.
User: Exporting files to PDF should have the same capabilities as JPG exports, also the limited fonts available.","The user primarily uses Figma for early creative processes and collaboration with international teams, appreciating its stability and quick whiteboarding capabilities. However, they find the notes feature lacking compared to Google Docs, and face challenges with collaboration restrictions on the unpaid version and security concerns for protecting intellectual property."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is always working on new features that help me as a UX Rersearcher to find new methods of organizing qualitative data, for example with Tags or the new clusters by Sentiment or keywords, among other features through Miro AI, which despite still being in an early stage are very promising.
User: I like the simple and intuitive interface that allows me to start creating right away with sticky notes or a mind map and progressively develop my work. I am very happy with the new features that come out, I always end up using the tags in the sticky notes, the creation of clusters and everything that can help me organize a lot of qualitative data from workshops.
User: The limitations in terms of typography, when I want to present data directly in Miro but I can't create presentations according to the company's identity is something that makes me have to move to other platforms, which is a shame because it works relatively well the part of creating interactive presentations.","Users appreciate Miro's collaboration capabilities, especially for remote workers, and its user-friendly interface with a wide range of templates. However, they suggest including more default shapes, such as those for Value Stream Mapping, to enhance its functionality."
figma,G2,"User: Miro helps to keep track of user feedback alongside screenshots of the product. It also allows for the team to collaborate in one space. It's very efficient!
User: Intuitive features, pleasing aesthetics, and the ability to collaborate with multiple users makes doing tasks in Miro more rewarding than other software.
User: While it's possible to separate projects into multiple Miro boards, it would be nice if there was a more built-in nesting feature. Adding a lot of screenshots can make Miro slower to load or it's more difficult to maintain resolution.","Users appreciate FigJam for its ease of use, especially for copywriters who need a visual way to organize their thoughts. It has become a key tool for team brainstorming sessions. However, some users would like to see more features added to make it more fun and interactive."
figma,G2,"User: The company I work at has little to no documentation regarding processes and strategy. With Miro I can easily create the first draft of a diagram/process and quickly add guests to collaborate and have a final version within 1 or 2 sessions of online collaboration. 
Additionally, Miro has helped me shift my problem-solving methodology from pen and paper and prose to visually abstracting the problem in a way that is easier, and more efficient, for my brain to process.
User: The tool's ease of use, the number and diversity of templates and the resources available for support. Creating visually stunning yet simple graphics is incredibly easy. As I began to use Miro more and more frequently in my workflow, my way of thinking and solving problems has shifted to be more visual ‚Äì¬†I am able to abstract my problems and express them on the screen in a powerful way.
User: I wish Miro had better tools to create, modify and import vector graphics. With its current set of tools it's cumbersome to create vector graphics and text, that would take seconds to make with the right set of tools.","The user appreciates Figma's collaborative features and free layer for small teams, which helps in conducting retrospectives and discussing strategies. However, they find the limitation of three boards and the need to pay for certain components restrictive."
figma,G2,"User: Miro help us to improve our processes by getting ideas in brainstormings for example. We also map process and use it to find the root causes of problems
User: Miro is an easy and nice platform for using with the team in meetings, with it the team can collaborate, write comments and create flows and so on. The userface is friendly as well.
User: When you are an administrator, paying for an whole team to use it, its kinda complicate to pay the bills. Here in our company we faced problems with it for the second time in two years.","User appreciates the features of Miro, including templates, clustering, and the timer, but finds the small frustrations frustrating, such as the automatic sorting of sticky notes."
figma,G2,"User: As an architect, Sharing ideas during sessions with large teams is impossible without whiteboard drawings. Miro also encourages innovation within our organization, driving ideas into reality using product and architecture designs.
User: I love the ease of authentication and content sharing, allowing teams to share drawings and ideas quickly.
User: Cost - might affect small teams. When boards are significantly large, we experience some lagging.","The user appreciates Figma for its user-friendly interface and ease in planning projects and generating flowcharts and mindmaps. They find the forums and FAQ websites helpful for answering questions. However, they suggest improvements such as compatibility with Microsoft Excel and the ability to lock rows and columns in tables."
figma,G2,"User: Facilitating hybrid/remote meetings. Having one spot for all your thoughts. Visual templates to organize your thought.
User: Very intuitive & handy tools. I facilitate brainstorm sessions an easily capture the entire group's discussion visually. 
Also very good for personal mind mapping and note-taking. 
 
Can only recommend!
User: 3 board limit for free accounts. Apart from that never had any issues with Miro.","Users appreciate Figjam for its simplicity and ease of use within the Figma suite, making it ideal for wireframing and collaboration with design and engineering teams. However, they note that its simplicity can also be a weakness, as it lacks some features found in competitors like Miro. Users hope for more feature additions to make Figjam a market leader."
figma,G2,"User: Miro creates a space for all team members to collaborate and communicate efficiently in one place. We can visualize and report development progress together.
User: I love the visual aspects of using Miro. I can make mood boards, project outlines, and line design process maps for every season of my design development.
User: Sometimes Miro can be very slow. I understand that I probably upload more/larger images than most as a Miro user.","Users appreciate Miro as a collaborative tool for team events, as it allows simultaneous contributions and reduces feelings of separation. However, they find some formatting options, such as sizing and tables, to be cumbersome and difficult to work with."
figma,G2,"User: Miro gives a remote team a place to collaborate that is accessible on any device with internet access. It has become as fast as writing notes by hand, rather than the sometimes extensive start-up required on other platforms. Even rudimentary diagrams and sketches are easy to create in real-time. There is an opportunity to have asynchronous discourse through the comments.
User: It is extremely intuitive to get started as a new user. It has become an essential tool for remote collaboration on my team of primarily visual thinkers. It is easy to go from loose sticky note ideas to a full deliverable sketch (or even the final deliverable in some cases). The tool is so flexible we have had to apply some rigor as a team to use it consistently and get the most out of comments, notes, etc. 
 
I love that the Miro team is always pushing updates and new features. I also like the available training tools, templates, and frequent presentations hosted by Miro that feature Miro employees as well as outside users.
User: The dislikes are more about features I wish were included, such as better interoperability between Miro and Excel, as well as data visualization capabilities. I would like the ability to create vector symbols/shapes and add custom fonts. I also wish that there were more features that catered to printed media - such as the ability to create paragraph styles and formatting templates with labels that could be adjusted on an instance-basis, but still referred back to a primary layout.","User finds Figjam easy to use and flexible for their needs in aligning key initiatives and brainstorming sessions. However, they face challenges in granting access to others and occasionally experience functionality issues."
figma,G2,"User: Way to collaborate virtually with the whole team! It gives us great templates to use for many different situations and makes meetings and trainings more collaborative.
User: We are virtual team - using Miro allows us to collaborate and build things together. I enjoy that Miro provides a number of features that doesn't make it just a whiteboard but also a presentation, training, sharing of ideas & templates, voting.
User: Some of the navigation things can trip people up from time to time and I find that the privacy settings can be hard to figure out if you are trying to lock down specific sensitive boards or spaces.","The user finds Figma valuable for remote team collaboration, using it for workshops, presentations, design critiques, and more. However, they struggle with the ""line"" tool, as it behaves like a connection flow and gets stuck with objects, suggesting a need for a line that behaves as a shape."
figma,G2,"User: Miro solves the visualization problem for my clients by showing how my solutions (I sell software) work within their business models. Using Miro goes beyond the pre-sales process, as it also helps to diagram implementation processes, identifying the various technical and human aspects of the equation. 
 
While words go a long way, making a diagram and showing processes step-by-step make operations functional in my line of work. It's also great to build business plans for teams, as it allows everyone to collaborate without the hindrance of size limitations in a presentation or a document.
User: Miro provides an all-hands approach to workflow design, where my team can not only collaborate and operate effectively, but I can also work my way through various business, marketing, and sales demands. 
 
From collaborations to creating operational plans to designing workflows and chat journeys for my clients, Miro is an all-encompassing tool to drag-and-drop design. It's easy to use and intuitive, giving users a simple approach to anything they desire to illustrate, with pre-designed templates that make working a breeze.
User: Sometimes the scroll methodology can be a hassle, specially when you're first starting to use it. While it does impact usability perception, it's not as much as a hassle once you get the grip of how navigation works within Miro.","Users appreciate FigJam for consolidating multiple tools, improving access across the company, and being intuitive for collaboration and brainstorming. They enjoy the templates, timer, stickers, and music features. However, they suggest adding an anonymity feature for stickies to maintain psychological safety during retrospectives."
figma,G2,"User: With Miro we can now use one system with endless space to build upon. We dont run into space issues anymore and everyone can easily access and edit it, whereas before that was more difficult.
User: I am a merchant who uses Miro to collaborate with design when building our seasonal assortment. I love how intuitive and visual it is.
User: It has difficulty loading once the boards are built. I create and build on lots of boards, but it needs to be able to withstand lots of boards and images to be a collaborative visual platform.","The user finds Miro excellent for facilitating collaboration during workshops and team-based activities, praising its real-time collaboration capabilities, wide range of tools and templates, and rich media integration. However, they experience performance issues with large boards or many simultaneous users and feel that customization options can be restrictive."
figma,G2,"User: It allows a space to work on all the elements of product management at the same time. 
 
Being able to have additional context with distributed teams is paramount to succeeding with a new product.
User: The variety of templates makes it easy to capture ideas and product development from start to finish.
User: I think it has been easier on products like Mural to make an outline of your work to jump around. If the feature exists I don't really see it used.","Users appreciate Figma for its ability to turn abstract thoughts into cohesive solutions and providing a clear direction for teams. They find Miro helpful for working abstractly and keeping track of their work, offering a better interface than PowerPoint. However, some users find the numerous options overwhelming and struggle to decide on the right approach."
figma,G2,"User: Brainstorming, wireframing, presentation, roadmap, etc.
User: Ease of use and capability. Miro enables!
User: I'm not quite sure yet. It's great for my use.","Users appreciate Figma for its ability to facilitate cross-functional collaboration and encourage creativity in a playful and approachable manner. However, they would prefer a more seamless integration between Figma and Figjam files to avoid having to search for or reference multiple files."
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration across large teams, A way to visually present processes and strategy
User: Great for collaboration and data visualization
User: There needs to be additional pricing structures available. The current ones are cost-prohibitive for teams that are casual Miro users","User finds visual interpretation easy to consume and appreciates the flexibility of using platforms like Miro for collaboration. However, they initially found it challenging to adapt to the platform."
figma,G2,"User: Ability to share visions/ ideas/ plans with others.
User: Ability to track anything - add anything - move things around easily
User: My sheets are limited b/c of my organization. Very few dislikes...","Users appreciate Miro's quick and easy-to-use ideation and collaboration features, including stickies, images, and templates. However, some team members are hesitant to adopt the tool, possibly due to new tool overload."
figma,G2,"User: Collaborating with people in different locations and timezones 
Repository - bringing multimedia assets related to a single project into one space 
Collaborating without a tool like this would be incredibly difficult.
User: As a UX researcher, I've been using Miro for years. It helped me collaborate remotely before the pandemic forced everyone to go remote. I've used it for project management, research synthesis, collaboration and feedback and even lightweight design. The templates help save time when putting together something like a Gantt or Kanban board. An absolute must for remove workshops: love the timer, background musing, voting, 'Follow me' mode. Very easy to learn.
User: The UI has gotten a bit busy, with controls in all 4 corners of the screen. I supposed it's expected for a tool that does so many jobs.","User appreciates the ease of collaboration and sharing information with remote whiteboarding sessions facilitated by FigJam, and mentions that non-designers have started to adopt it in their workflows. They also suggest adding more visual options to the platform to create more customized and visually exciting files."
figma,G2,"User: Miro gives us the ability to collaborate, teach, learn, share, and be in one place no matter where in the world we live. It is extremely valuable in these times where costs are of the utmost concern and we try to continue our ability to get together as teams to accomplish our goals.
User: I like the ability to customize and build the collaboration space that is most effective. I look through the templates and Miroverse to begin as inspiration and then build to support the goals of the session.
User: The structure for us to do multiple sessions within our company is due to the terms of our contract. It becomes a little prohibitive based on the number of people and days we need to be most effective.","User appreciates the infinite canvas, voting, stickers, and rich diagramming tools in Figma, as well as multiple app integration, allowing them to use it as their primary productivity tool. They also appreciate the lack of a private space in the enterprise version, which only allows them to keep documents for themselves."
figma,G2,"User: Miro helps with the problem of gaining consensus among a disparate group of Product team planners. Miro boarding all the different ideas, then being able to shuffle them into priority order can more quickly help solidify the team plan and direction.
User: I like the collaborative nature of the Miro app. Live-time editing with multiple team members is easy. It's a good replacement solution for a conference room whiteboard, especially when many members in a large corporate structure often work remotely or travel.
User: Cutting and pasting into the Miro board allows vision comparisons using graphic elements but some desired items can't be easily placed; excel tables and HTML get shredded. Also, I'd like to see a little more robust editing of post-it note styles.","User finds FigJam highly intuitive and easy to use for diagramming site maps and content sections for websites, but notes that the types of content that can be added to a board are somewhat limited."
figma,G2,"User: easier to create real time diagrams and share with clients, capture clients input in form of diagrams.
User: Realtime collaboration with multiple team members
User: really difficult to create sequence diagrams. Also to use templates as most of them are paid","Users appreciate Miro as a digital whiteboarding tool that enables effective collaboration for globally distributed teams, offering features for workshops and brainstorming sessions. However, they find the access permissions for teams within an organization confusing."
figma,G2,"User: lack of freeform tools on the market with lots of customization, which is why I prefer Miro to its competitors that I've tried
User: the flexibility to collaborate with others, and mainly the freeform design
User: text box limits, lack of automatic spell correction, constant new feature/update pop-ups","The user appreciates the flexibility, accessibility, and ease of use of the Miro board, which allows for collaborative input, effort, and process management. They also appreciate the ability to track changes and revert changes through the history. The user also mentions that the large Miro board may take time to load, and some setup may be unlocked, causing unintentional movement. The user also mentions that the page upload is blurry and slow."
figma,G2,"User: I usually use Miro to map out the user flows, customer journey maps, personas, IA, etc. I also use it a lot for user research analysis, such as affinity maps, empathy maps, competitor analysis, etc.
User: As for workshops, the sticky notes and votings are very convenient. And adding background music with the timer helps create a more joyful environment during the workshops. Some built-in templates are easy to use, which has made my work more efficient.
User: Could provide more formats for file exports.","User appreciates Miro for its extensive collection of templates and collaboration features, which make meetings more productive. However, they find it difficult to use for simple tasks like jotting down meeting notes."
figma,G2,"User: Now, with my Enterprise team in Miro, I can manage how my different teams are evolving in Continuous Improvement Initiatives. This is very helpful to understand the challenges.
User: Real-time collaboration for different teams. Saving money by avoiding business travel for workshops and meetings.
User: It could be more intuitive for early adopters.","Users appreciate FigJam's integration with Figma, its collaborative nature, and features like timers, spotlighting, stickers, auto-align tools, and community templates. However, they find mindmaps more challenging compared to competitors and wish for improvements in image resizing and a chat feature for better collaboration."
figma,G2,"User: Miro allows multiple users to simultaneously share ideas as visuals within the same space without disruption. This feature makes it very helpful for any roadmap planning session. A team can always return to a Miro board after to recap what has been shared or continue the work.
User: I find Miro helpful in brainstorming sessions, prototyping new digital products, or mapping a flow chart. It is easy to share and export a Miro file to different formats.
User: I wouldn't say I like that there is no integration between Miro and Microsoft PowerPoint yet, and I believe many users have raised the same request. Since graphic and drawing tools on Miro are better, we want to have the ability to work between the two platforms to present any idea better.","Users find Miro valuable for enabling real-time collaboration among distributed teams and appreciate its adaptability for various meetings and workshops. They also like the continuous development of new features. However, some users may need basic training or resources to get accustomed to the navigation and features of the online whiteboarding tool."
figma,G2,"User: it makes possible to design visual roadmaps and OKRs that we can easily edit with co-workers. Also it's really good for mapping meetings and brainstorming
User: it is easy to share with my co-workers and to organize my boards in the projects
User: most of the templates are not as pretty as they could be, and when my annual subscription ended I had a hard time getting it be renewed","Users find Figma helpful for collaboration within teams, gathering feedback, presenting ideas, and appreciate the variety of templates available. However, sharing feedback outside the organization can be challenging."
figma,G2,"User: I manage global teams so using Miro allows us to collaborate cross multiple regions. No version issues, just a seamless experience. 
Clients love it and find it easy to use. 
It makes information easier to view.
User: Ability to collaborate easily remotely. Easy to use. Great for project kick offs, workshops, keeping everything in one place. 
Displays information in a much more easily digestible way.
User: Sometimes I find the membership confusing - I never know who can or cannot access boards. Also where boards sit - whether in one team or another - this could be simplified.","Figma users appreciate the platform's ability to facilitate collaboration between design, research, and product teams, leading to improved customer experiences. However, they suggest that Figjam should allow collaboration with external partners, such as implementation partners."
figma,G2,"User: I use it for a lot of Scrum Master ceremonies like Sprint Retrospectives, PI Planning, collaborating on story writing etc. It is an easy to use collaborative tool
User: It's a collaborative whiteboard that I can use for multiple purposes. Being a Scrum Master, I use it for SAFe PI Planning. I have not used other products much
User: I have to re-load Miro every time you let the screen idle and go to another tab and then come back to Miro.","Users appreciate Figma for its ease of use and numerous features, especially in a remote work environment, as it helps reduce paper waste."
figma,G2,"User: I have created a Creative Hack workshop template which I use to help teams and clients come up with ideas. 
I'll also use Miro for other team tasks in which multiple people need to make inputs. 
Its helpful for capturing a large amount of information in a little amount time, and ultimately making sense of those inputs.
User: I describe Miro as an Adobe Illustrator Group Chat. I love the drag and drop flexibility of it and ease of use, which allows me to capture ideas and feedback in real time. Even when I'm working with large groups of people, the tool enables me to synthesize conversations and sharebacks in a way that captures the essence of a meeting.
User: I have a few small feedback options for Miro. 
 
1. For some reason I am forced to put a password on a board when I make it publically editable. It didn't used to be like this and I find it annoying that I have to do that every time. I end up just saying ""miroboard"" for everything. 
 
2. When I invite outside of my org participants to join a board. Via the UX they often think they have to sign up to view the board, which leads to time lost in the session correcting them and getting them to the board as a guest quickly. 
 
3. Not sure if this is still the case but I wish I could give people outside of my ""team"" permission to lock objects. I work across teams so sometimes I'm unable to lock assets on colleagues' boards and vice versa.","Users appreciate the simplicity of Figma's whiteboard tool for organization and find it easy to use. However, they preferred the free plan and find connecting arrows in reverse to be tricky."
figma,G2,"User: I can create a storyboard and document all my data/ logistic findings, planning/ schedule in an organized fashion, with enough flexibility for color choices, formatting support for the planning process.
User: Flexible to create mind mapping, planning and collaborative workshop. Easy to navigate and link tools to support my work.
User: When the file is getting large with alot of PDFs, the zoom tool is jumpy. Also when sharing Miro board on MS team video call/ zoom call, there is alot of lagging time.","The user appreciates Figma as a valuable tool for remote team brainstorming and collaboration, highlighting the ease of transferring content between FigJam and Figma files. They suggest adding a feature to quickly organize notes and writings in FigJam and convert them into a structured document format."
figma,G2,"User: This is my #1 choice of tool when collaborating with clients. My team uses Miro to document a strategy or wireframe and collect client feedback in real-time, it helps ensure the client that we are listening to their wants and needs. Instead of using a static PPT where we are just jotting down the notes, clients can see the work in action. In addition, we use the Miro board to document processes and attach key artifacts and URLS. This process documentation is exhaustive but Miro allows users to zoom in and out from a micro/macro view to learn about the process which is great for leadership to see and great for onboarding. It especially works for a global remote company where we can all jump in to review no matter the time zone. If you are in the same time zone, it works great to get everyone in the room and use as a collaboration tool. For example, I'm located in California and my client is located in the UK. We use miro to make updates on our timezone and get very detailed in specific areas of question. It allows for transparency, review, and collaboration.
User: In general, I like the whiteboarding and mapping capabilities that allow for deep thought, process documentation, and pure collaboration with teams. It allows me to jot my rough thoughts on paper where I then can find patterns and create a more solid process. Miro is the perfect think tank environment that you use from start (ideation) to a finish (a solid concept). It's also great for inviting colleagues for feedback or collaboration. Anyone can use it with a free license.
User: Miroboards have a size capacity where if you add too many screenshots, it starts to slow down. It can also get extremely messy and often confusing for a new user coming in and unsure where to start. Sometimes if you start your miroboard too big, the details of things like adding arrow connectors can be really tiny. Causing me to selecting all and sizing down my space so you can see these details. I sometimes run into issues with font formatting, if I copied and pasted a highlighted text in bold and then I drag in the text widget, it will copy what I've used when that is not my intention. It's really just the small details that I wish were fixed that could make my experience more easier.",The user appreciates Figma's ease in creating whiteboards for moodboards and presentations but finds it challenging to locate options for adding links or importing images and creating clipping masks.
figma,G2,"User: Miro is creating a low-cost space for our dispersed teams and clients to meet virtually and unlock both key questions and solutions driving toward our project goals and milestones.
User: Miro is a great collaborative tool, and one that we use both internally and with our external clients. We have formulated complex business objectives through workshops, and Miro is such a great tool to replace the whiteboard / sticky note in-person sessions when you have extremely dispersed teams.
User: Miro is not highly intuitive for me just in terms of mouse / keyboard functions. I hate the thought of needing to take time to figure out if I can change these settings, and it would be really cool to almost have different preset options (almost like a preferred controller setup for a gaming system).","Users appreciate Miro for its ease of collaboration and brainstorming across teams, especially for storyboard direction. However, they find that boards with a lot of content can become slow."
figma,G2,"User: MIRO helps me manage a project schedule with complex deliverables, timeline, swimlane owners, and key cross-functional dependencies. It also helps with basic product roadmap and innovation planning. The visual appeal is also helpful as it can serve as a presentation board for senior management presentations.
User: MIRO is an ideal tool for facilitating collaboration across teams or large groups. I use it with my teams for a variety of applications, including planning project schedules, brainstorming ideas, mapping out solutions and process flow diagrams. It is highly flexible, allowing the user to define the structure and content. I really like the ease of use and the infinite space, which allows you to constantly be adding to existing boards. There are many existing templates that help provide a good starting point for collaboration.
User: One of the challenges that we've seen is integration with other software. I'd like to see a more seamless integration with MS Excel--for instance, the ability to capture live Excel spreadsheets in MIRO that are auto-updates as the underlying Excel sheet changes.","The user appreciates the collaboration features of Miro, which allow team members to work together regardless of location. They also appreciate the digital whiteboard, which allows teams to capture ideas, organize information, and make decisions in real-time. The user finds the tool easy to use and appreciates the zoom in/zoom out feature. However, they find it challenging to use from mobile internet due to the high-speed internet requirement."
figma,G2,"User: Wonderful platform to collaborate when teams are remote; the ability to share and brainstorm ideas has become super easy, accessibility anywhere is much more convenient
User: I've used the tool for brainstorming, ideation, planning, project management, and flowcharting - it has a wide range of ready-to-use templates to pick from for a head start
User: Ability to animate the process flows for a walkthrough, integration with Microsoft Office suite or Google Platforms with edit features."," The User is benefiting from Figma by using it for editing and finishing touches for their work as a graphic designer and drafter. The User loves Figma because it allows them to get things done quickly and accurately, as well as providing helpful features such as prototyping and smart animate. Additionally, the User appreciates the supportive community available to them. The User finds that when using the resize option (Ctrl-K), the design options on the side toolbar go away, which they understand but can be confusing if they forget they are in resize mode."
figma,G2,"User: Agile retrospectives, root cause analysis, visualizing a road map, placing tasks in a schedule. Allows team to interactively edit at the same time. More efficient.
User: We were able to use an existing Miro template for a Fishbone diagram (Ashikawa) diagram for determining root cause analysis. Very well received by the audience. We broke into 5 team who each used the template to populate root cause post-its.
User: I wish the zoom percentage was user definable. There are times when the pre-defined options don't fit my screen well. Either it is too small to read the text in the post-its or it is too large to show the full size of the diagram. It would be great to be allowed to enter a custom percentage.","The user is benefiting from Figma's product by being able to visually map out and share their thoughts with colleagues. This is an improvement from the free tools they used in the past, which lacked many features that Figma offers. The User enjoys being able to collaborate with colleagues in a visual way, allowing them to easily problem-solve and make actionable next steps. The User found it took some time to become familiar with all of the features of the product."
figma,G2,"User: Online diagramming among multiple team members in hybrid setup. Having multiple diagrams in one canvas is also a plus.
User: 1) Doing collaboration using Miro stickys, diagrams are a must these days specially among hybrid teams 
2) Variety of templates (with pre-filled info ro empty) to quickly start diagramming, we dont need to start from scratch
User: 1) When exporting to pdf, it does not capture the title of the frame - it should capture the title of frame, its a must. 
2) When we land on page, it should be by default on 100% zoom, currently it is not 
3) There should be a feature to organize the blocks in the diagram, so that we dont spend time organizing it 
4) Double arrow is missing from the connector list 
5) Connectors should show overlapping when crossing another connector","The user appreciates the versatility and ease of use of Miro, especially for remote work and collaboration with clients. They appreciate the templates and templates' ability to store information for later use. However, they find the board too responsive and dizzying when teammates move around it, and they need more practice zooming in and out."
figma,G2,"User: Centralized place for notes and priority dicussions
User: Best tool for Retrospective meeting notes, Review and feedback on any design or document etc,
User: Sometimes its works very slowly. I like all features the other features","The user loves the collaborative and creative nature of their team's process, which allows them to share ideas and create individual workspaces on the same board. They suggest adding more colors to the post-its to allow for more unique themes."
figma,G2,"User: Miro presented a wonderful solution for the team to gather around a 'digital whiteboard' and has enabled us to use our agile training for roadmap planning, daily standups, and so much more.
User: I truly love the colors of the boxes, the flexibility of the drag-n-drop approach to building out slides, slideshows, and presentations. The learning curve is low, anyone who takes the online classes can learn how to use Miro efficiently.
User: There is a bit of a time cost to signing up for a beginners online class, but the instructors are very enjoyable and have a wonderful enthusiasm that is contagious.","Users appreciate Figma for its ability to track changes, inbuilt brainstorming features, and ease of collaboration for remote teams. They also find it cost-effective, easy to implement, and appreciate its seamless integrations with third-party tools."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is easy to use, and has key features that assist in my diagramming. The template I use counts the number of items within a 'cell', and this helps me identify when I'm assigning too many tasks to a given week.
User: Miro has several templates and features that make it unique. This diversity supports different uses, and I can both manage projects and gather feedback through other assets
User: It lacks integration with other services (e.g. Notion), and it also lacks screen reading capabilities for (visual) accessibility. The lack of accessibility is the one thing keeping my organization from using it more widespread.","The user finds the tool extremely valuable for team resolution of complex problems, promoting participation, and organizing, sharing, and designing knowledge. They appreciate the unlimited whiteboard features and the ability to freeze the first row and column view. The user dislikes the inability to freeze the first row and column view for large tables in excel."
figma,G2,"User: Team collaboration, brainstorming, idea consolidation, timeline and roadmap creation, documentation of ideation and feedback, easy collaboration with internal and external parties.
User: I have been using Miro on and off for roughly 3 years now, and I always find myself gravitating to it. Whether internal meetings or external meetings with clients, the tool is valuable for conducting whiteboarding sessions, brainstorming ideas, and overall collaborating with larger teams. I have also used it for project retrospectives, creating timelines, and wireframing dashboards. It is user-friendly and has every connection/capability I can think of!
User: I honestly can't think of anything. The connections are great, the interface is sleek, and the application as a whole is very user-friendly. Maybe optimizing mouse scrolls for easier navigation within a board? But even that is very smooth as-is.","Users appreciate Miro's ease of collaboration, flexibility, and smooth scrolling and zooming features. However, they find the wireframe library's icons to be minimal and have difficulty changing colors in IconFinder. Additionally, they experience issues with note-taking, such as lack of spell check and challenges in managing layer ordering."
figma,G2,"User: Best collaborative tool and number of things updated on figjam UI, so it'll be easy for new users also
User: With figjam you can do endless collaboration with your team from creating sticky notes, create frame and work as a team and also it's user interface is very simple to use.
User: As a user of figma and figjam for almost 2 yrs, i don't have anything to dislike","Users appreciate Figma as an alternative to traditional project onboarding and collaboration tools, as it provides a central source of truth and facilitates remote work. They enjoy the ability to easily add various elements and use templates for project collaboration, feedback sessions, and brainstorming. However, some users find it difficult to navigate around boards and experience occasional glitches, while new users may feel overwhelmed by the range of functions."
figma,G2,"User: Day to day UX U for product and for all marketing creatives
User: I love the fact that I am able to work with my teammates simultaneously and with follow the cursor part it becomes so efficient in design collaboration
User: I am unable to export file in a single pdf they always get saved as different pdfs","Users appreciate Figma's flexibility and ease of use for ideation, brainstorming, and creating UX flows, especially when collaborating with stakeholders. However, they experience slow loading times and occasional crashes with screens full of wireframes, and would like more variety in post-it forms and sizes."
figma,G2,"User: The colorful board, sticky and other things keep people busy and interactive. I like playing around while using it. It also brings more clarity about how and where we are proceeding with our goal
User: The ability to interact on the same board makes it easy to see where are people progressing and it makes it more interactive
User: There is as such nothing which I dislike but if we can add timers for a particular sticky or ability to add date for a particular board is possible that would be great","The user enjoys using Figma for product development with team members, appreciating its variety of templates, stickers, and widgets, as well as its availability on both web and desktop versions. They suggest improving the user interface to make it more visually pleasing."
figma,G2,"User: Before Figma I had a hard time meeting up with customer requirements for Prototyping and Wireframing of mobile apps and web landing pages, I was using Photoshop and it was quite tasking. With Figma, my designs are easier, I complete them faster and I have access to more methods specifically meant for UI/UX
User: It is not as restrictive as other design applications. It is very free, easy incorporation of external files that contribute to the general design, and an interface that even a beginner can get around with ease
User: Requires a fast internet connection, and saves all your work to the cloud so a stable internet connection is a must while working. Cloud storage is an appreciable feature but offline functionality is a must-have feature as well","Users appreciate Miro for its ability to identify and articulate ideas, as well as its simple and easy-to-use online collaboration features. They particularly enjoy the brainstorming capabilities and integration of frames for storytelling. However, they find Miro expensive due to per-user licensing and would prefer the option to share read-only boards without consuming additional licenses."
figma,G2,"User: Helping me document user research insights, it's great how flexible the tool is and particularly like the timer function to help with workshop timing
User: I lose the freedom and flexibility of the board. The timer and music makes it super easy to do silent critting!
User: When working within a team, I find it very difficult to see boards of other members. I think you could do a better job of telling me what projects are mine","Users appreciate Figma's cloud-based collaboration tool with multiple features for various team roles and its whiteboard nature for remote collaboration across teams. They find the pre-existing templates useful for quick tasks. However, they experience slow page refreshing and lack an index for quick navigation within the board."
figma,G2,"User: It helps me create wireframes and designs for my worklace.
User: It makes it very easy to share my ideas and vision with the team.
User: I feel it is a bit tricky tool to use. Not very comfortable in the beginning.","The user appreciates Figma for consolidating project information and facilitating remote, real-time work. They also value the constant improvements, templates, and Miroverse resources. However, they suggest adding more insight tools and better ways to summarize visual data, noting that the current sticky notes feature is still in beta and not applicable to other visual aids."
figma,G2,"User: I had a problem of trying to show someone the visual design that was in my head. By using figjam, and an add-on to download examples of designs, I was able to put together a mockup of a design to collaborate with my team and determine a solution that worked for us. The prototype feature meant I was then able to present our mockups to the CEO acting as a functional website. The presentation was a hit, and we got approval to move forward with the changes.
User: The amount of powerful features built into the free version is incredible. I'm using Figjam daily, from mockups of new websites to even simple UI designs to send to our engineering team. The ability to prototype a working design is amazing. There are some crazy good add-ons that you can use to extend the program for insane time-saving benefits.
User: It feels a bit overwhelming when you open it at first, and sometimes things may behave unexpectedly because you might not realise one of the settings is enabled e.g. clip content for a frame.","User appreciates Figma's real-time group collaboration and integration of Figjam files, but notes that non-design teams may find it difficult to understand."
figma,G2,"User: Flexible platform for remote teams to work together on a visual level.
User: As a user of FigJam, I absolutely love the collaborative features of this tool. It's so easy to share my FigJam boards with team members and work together in real-time, no matter where we are located. The interface is also really intuitive and user-friendly, which makes it easy to get started with minimal training. Another thing I love about FigJam is its versatility - I can use it for everything from brainstorming ideas to creating wireframes and user flows.
User: It doesn't offer as many advanced design features as some other design tools on the market. While it's great for brainstorming and creating quick sketches or diagrams, it may not be the best choice for more complex design work.","Users prefer Miro over PowerPoint and virtual whiteboards due to its unrestricted format and ability to add extensive information. They find it particularly useful for project discovery, creating diagrams, and mindmaps. However, they struggle with formatting diagrams and find templates difficult to adapt."
figma,G2,"User: Helping me document my sales process and customer journey
User: There are templates that get you a great start and are super easy to use
User: I didn't realize that it worked right into Figma, but once I figured that out it was awesome.","Users appreciate Figma for its simplicity and ease of use in visualizing and communicating plans, facilitating workshops, and engaging participants. They also find it helpful to invite multiple guests to virtual meetings and export content to PowerPoint for presentations."
figma,G2,"User: Miro really helps when something has to be explained to the customer, we can easily create a plan together or visualize some ideas. It very much helped me get through the workshops I had to host.
User: Collaboration features are very useful, I can easily share link to Miro board with our clients and they don't even have to create Miro account or use Miro app to be able to collaborate. 
What I also like about Miro are multiple tools that we can use to create boards like sticky notes, diagrams, tables, shapes and so on.
User: Thing that I dislike about Miro is that when I click a link to the Miro board (for examlpe shared on Slack) it will open in both website and native app on my PC and I end up having same Miro board opened twice.",Users appreciate FigJam for its ease of use and its ability to improve collaboration with their team and customers.

User: There are some things that you have to get used to, for example: when you insert images they are going to be extremely large so you have to be careful because if you shrink them outside of the frame they disappear. The organization of grouped elements could also be better because it gets confusing when too many elements are used.","The product is helping the User with their discovery process, creating opportunity solutions trees, roadmaps, and timelines. The User loves that Miro provides an ""infinite space"" for presentations, unlike PowerPoint which is limited to slides.

User: The built-in templates, collaboration features, and familiar feel to Figma.

They appreciate the upcoming features, but some users may initially find the interface overwhelming or experience slow loading times with large boards."
figma,G2,"User: We needed a one-stop shop to handle all our design and mind mapping and due to the fact that the company that makes this is Figma we have Figma and FigJam both under one connected roof.
User: FigJam is easy to use and very stable, we have never lost progress or seen any hiccups while using this platform. We have all the tools and features we could ever need for collaborating together! Also, the cost is extremely reasonable!
User: They could improve the sharing process. right now anyone on a team account can add editors and charge the licenses to the organization. there is a way to restrict users from being able to just add anyone to a design, but it requires an account upgrade to the enterprise plan resulting in an increase in cost.","Users appreciate Figma's team collaboration features, compatibility with Microsoft Teams and Office, and the availability of templates. However, they note that the platform lacks the ability to preserve links to data and automatically update it from the source."

User: The way it seamlessly allows for collaboration for remote teams makes FigJam a great asset. 
 
Remote has a stigma around it that it limits collaboration; however FigJam makes it easy!
User: FigJam is very intuitive, but in some ways, it is feature-light. It's great if you want a broad range of ideas from small teams but when you need a more complex solution, you may hit some snags.","Users find Miro helpful for creating mindmaps, sharing with clients and stakeholders, and working collaboratively on product development.

figma,G2,"User: As a marketing team the ability to hop on a call, play some music, and brainstorm is great. We use it for review, critique and team building. Its just a really fun simple place to take care of these tasks.
User: I really like the ability within Figjam to use templates for different brainstorming and creative exercises. The prebuilt sticker elements and elements are beneficial for getting up and going right away. I also think it is just a powerful collaborative tool.
User: I think Figjam is just a little finicky around resizing fonts and slightly more design type collab. I am a bit more used to the full functions of Figma, and would like some more of that design flexibility within FigJam too.","User finds FigJam helpful for sharing ideas with others and easy to use after some practice, but feels it lacks intuitiveness with some features being difficult to locate in the menus."

User: FigJam is Versatile for Teams. We have used it for a small team that has designers, developers, and content team members.
User: If you aren't a designer, it can be hard to learn.","The user finds Figma beneficial for its simplicity, faster task completion, and easy sharing and communication features compared to other design tools. They particularly appreciate the ""Share"" function due to its web-based nature. However, they suggest adding a native ""PDF to Figma"" feature, as it currently requires a plugin."
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration, comments, and grouping is one of the best features that solved decision making capabilities.

figma,G2,"User: We use it to run workshops and it has been of great aid as clients adopt it easily after a 10-minute onboarding. 
Also, it has helped us to organize visually a lot of information, for example, inputs from branding or users Research. 
We have simulated some apps to test how will them help us before purchasing them
User: It's an easy-to-use tool and has a lot of templates available. It's intuitive and has features to work collaboratively such as voting, reactions with funny interaction effects, a timer (with music now), widgets, editing tools, etc.
User: Sharing boards or files it's a bit billing-tricky. You may be charged extra seats if you don't pay attention and share links directly. 
The selection between reactions and vote tools is not enough clear as they share the same wheel","The user highly appreciates Figma for its versatility in mapping, flow design, brainstorming, and project monitoring, as well as its real-time collaboration feature. They recommend it to others but suggest adding translations, such as Portuguese, to make it more accessible for non-English speakers."
figma,G2,"User: Like a whiteboard for us as a remote team
User: Very intuitive for design - easy to move things around and align
User: Not much really - I guess you need a big monitor to see stuff sometimes because the pages can be really wide","Users highly praise Miro for its collaboration capabilities, making remote work and research activities more manageable and accessible. They appreciate the variety of templates, presentation features, private mode, and author identification on stickies. However, they find exporting stickies to CSV format challenging and would like more customization options for sticky note colors and diagramming themes."

User: Everything is best can‚Äôt complain about anything in the tool. I find it pretty good when it comes to user experience and the way you can freely design and swim through the platform","Users appreciate Miro for its engaging and intuitive interface, especially for retrospectives and team-building activities. They find the templates and integrations valuable, but some users wish for a free trial of the pro version and a dark mode feature."

It serves its purpose very well.","Users appreciate Figma for its ability to develop processes in one place and share progress with colleagues and leadership, resulting in increased productivity.

figma,G2,"User: Design Creation for software development and then sharing the design for review and approval in addition to being used as a QA Resource during testing and verification of user stories.
User: Great way to see designs and then compare for QA purposes. The UI is fairly easy to understand when reviewing and comments are simple to add and resolve.
User: when Sharing content you have to share the entire board or the process feels odd bc users open the link and can't necessarily easily access all the content. Felt very ""where am I"" upon opening links vs ""oh, this is what i need to do""","Users appreciate Miro for facilitating virtual meetings and brainstorming sessions across their global team, helping them plan activities and manage customer journey maps.

figma,G2,"User: FigJam provides all the essential tools and requirement for making UI/UX flows and design,
User: What I like about FigJam is the tools it provides for UI/UX designers that make their work faster and easier, the tools cover everything that would be required in a workflow and UI design, also the Figma design can be shared with clients for view only or with edit permission which gives flexibility
User: I think the FigJam enterprise plan is a bit overpriced, the features in this plan are amazing but the price is quite high to be paid monthly","User enjoys using Figma for brainstorming and continuing discussions on the same virtual whiteboard, but finds it heavy to use, causing issues for participants with weak network connections."

User: easy to collaborate with team members and create excellent visualizations

User: I really like how Figma is easy to use. Helpful tutorials for finding and downloading plugins to achieve everything you need. Easy to collaborate on this tool!
User: No built in flattening tool (when exporting file as pdf). If there is a built in flattening tool, it would be really helpful. For now, you would need to export each page as png and then reinsert to get around the lack of flattening tool.","Users appreciate Miro for its ability to streamline creative collaboration and provide a single platform for idea sharing and project management. They enjoy the accessibility and endless possibilities for creativity. However, they experience performance issues when boards have too much content, causing slow editing and freezing. Improving performance with heavy boards is a suggested improvement."
figma,G2,"User: I use figjam primarily for personal use, for conceptualizing ideas, storyboards, and sometimes for basic wireframes (it's sometimes quicker than Figma). For some such situations, I used multiple tools like google docs/slides or PPT, Photoshop, and Paint. Now I had to use only one...
User: I absolutely loved Figma, but I had never used any whiteboard app before FigJam. And I absolutely love it. It is so much easier to conceptualize stuff. I have started to like it much better than a physical paper. Earlier, I used multiple apps like google docs/slides, and Photoshop. Instead, now I use only figjam in those situations.
User: Till now, nothing, and as I have not used any other whiteboarding app, I can not identify any limitation of the app",The user appreciates Figma's features for facilitating remote workshops and enabling collaboration but finds it difficult to organize the workspace and locate previously created items.
figma,G2,"User: Collecting research over time, and having collaboration from key stakeholders.
User: Love the flexibility and endless canvas for organizing ideas w/colleagues
User: Sometimes images can be slow/low-res. And keeping organized between many boards is a struggle.","Users appreciate Figma's virtual sessions, real-time collaboration, versioning, ease of sharing, access management, and Jira integration.

One of the best things about FigJam is its ease of use and intuitive interface, which makes it simple for even non-designers to quickly create diagrams, flowcharts, wireframes, and other types of visual content.
User: sometimes UI could be complicated if you're a user that are not familiar with the FIGMA infinite canvas system (that you can scroll a lot and not find the end). Aside from that, is great"," Users appreciate Miro for its collaboration features, enabling teams to work together on presentations and designs more efficiently than with InDesign or PowerPoint. Miro is particularly helpful for remote team members, though some users may initially feel intimidated. While it offers more design flexibility, users may need to be creative to achieve desired results."
figma,G2,"User: Tool for colloboration which is as useful for remote companies
User: Best tool for design even without any design knowledge. Best tool for early stage companies who don't have any design experience
User: Eats too much of RAM space. Also feel some of the features aren't as exhaustive as MIRO.","Users appreciate Miro's digital whiteboard for its large canvas and collaboration capabilities, ideal for brainstorming and sharing ideas. However, they are uncertain about versioning support and organization of information within the platform."
figma,G2,"User: Collaboration tools are very important in this remote world that we're living in. FigJam provides our teams with a ""natural"" medium to collaborate with. We love it for retrospectives, group plannings, brainstorming, etc.
User: FigJam makes it easy to collaborate with a team on a variety of different use cases. From whiteboarding, to retrospectives, to planning meetings, to organizing information.
User: Because it is mostly unstructured, you or your team is left to decide what structure works best for your use case.","The product is helping the User to quickly analyse large amounts of data, identify correlations and gain new insights, all within a visually appealing format. Users appreciate the product's simplicity and intuitiveness, as well as its unlimited whiteboard space which is great for collaboration, forming new ideas, and making insights.

Additionally, the User has to continually log in to their work account if it has been inactive for a short while."
figma,G2,"User: Our company needs something easy to use and highly collaborative. Rather than use a separate product it is easy to use FigJam right in Figma.
User: FigJam is a fluid and easy to use collabarite environment. It is seamless to go from Figma to FigJam and back. The UI is simple and is great for working together.
User: It seems kind of expensive. I wish it was just included in a normal Figma subscription","The user appreciates Figma's visualization capabilities for various purposes, including strategy visuals, organizing information, and creating to-dos. They also enjoy the open-source templates. However, they dislike the inability to format shapes, issues with table formatting, and jagged connecting lines. They suggest improvements in these areas and request a critical path template."
figma,G2,"User: FigJam is solving the problem of communicating about technical system layouts with people who are not accustomed to verbally processing such layouts.
User: FigJam makes creating diagrams and flowcharts very easy! In my job, I often need visual aids to explain technical systems, and I need to create those aids more or less on the fly. FigJam has been a lifesaver in that regard.
User: My only complaints about FigJam are very small, the biggest of which is that I wish it were simpler to create multiple wire attachment points on one side of a shape, using a snap-to-grid alignment. There are times when I need 4+ discrete wires running into one side of a shape, and I don't necessarily want them all going to the central point.","Users appreciate Figma's ability to facilitate brainstorming exercises with multiple people in various locations, making the idea-sharing process more fair and democratic. However, they find the UI challenging to navigate and struggle with the zooming and sizing features."
figma,G2,"User: We could visualize an app design on the mobile screen before the actual design. Help understand the UI / UX before design implementation and coding
User: Ease of use and detailing in the app was really fantastic. It gives the feel of a real app before actual implementation. I think it is an awesome app to jam before you actually play!
User: Wanted to have a way to see transition of the screens if possible. Possibly, how does the app act when CTAs are clicked","Users prefer Miro over Figma for quickly creating and connecting shapes, arrows, and lines, as well as using templates. However, they find grouping and selecting objects within groups cumbersome and dislike the lack of padding between text and shape edges."
figma,G2,"User: I think it's a simple platform to be able to visually explain complicated things. Sometimes powerpoint and word just aren't the answer and FigJam does a great job of visually explaining.
User: It's really easy just to jump right in and get the hang of things. I don't have a lot of design experience (some experience with Adobe products), and I was able to catch onto this reasonably fast.
User: While I caught on quickly, I think there are many things where they went out of their way to make it different from other design platforms, which can be confusing sometimes.","Users appreciate Miro for its simple interface and online space for idea generation and organization. They find it useful for workshops and live collaboration, particularly using sticky notes for structuring sections and clustering ideas. However, they mention some limitations in formatting, image/object alignment, and connecting lines between shapes."
figma,G2,"User: it integrates with Trainual so we can embed flow charts into training content for clients
User: easy drag and drop; easy edit; no unecessary formatting
User: sometimes the zooming feature is tricky after coming from other platforms","The user appreciates the diverse and accessible whiteboard tool for use during meetings and collaboration, as well as the tagging features and drag-and-drop file features.

User: Miro is really easy to use and to interact with. I love that i could sketch something in second in order to explain an idea, use it for my big workshop or just create some retro
User: Sometimes i cannot zoom in or out. Another downside would be the multiple user where someone is placed right on your presentation spot and you cannot hide their mouse","Users appreciate Figma's ease of collaboration during brainstorming sessions and its fast, sleek workflow for creating diagrams and tables. However, they experience inconsistent navigation when changing device configurations, such as switching between mouse and touchpad input."
figma,G2,"User: - Online collaboration with team members. 
- A visual and active way to involve other participants. 
- Documentation of unstructured discussions. 
- Asyncronous collaboration
User: I am a novice user with expereince using other workshopping tools. 
Starting up to use the product was easy. I like that the onboarding helping messages are not coming up at the very first login, but slowly appearing when doing the work. So I actually have possibility to try them one-by-one. I am not overwhelmed with the amount of new information. 
I like that I can invite participants who does not have Miro account as a participant.
User: It is not very clear from the documentation what kind of user access shall I use when inviting external participants for workshops. What is the difference between view/comment/edit or visitor/guest users? 
I like the Figma Section feature, I have not found yet the alternative of that in Miro.","Users appreciate Figma for facilitating remote collaborative meetings and customer ceremonies, making scheduling easier. They enjoy the ease of use, interactivity, and templates compared to PowerPoint. However, some users find certain tools, like frames and form manipulation, complex and challenging to use. Additionally, they experience occasional slow loading times, but the cause is unclear."
figma,G2,"User: It has helped us to execute our duties from anywhere remotely. This has made the collaboration between us to be more effective and efficient.
User: Miro offers a better and a great platform to work in especially in the Morden market. It centralises every file that I make,helping me to see all that I did at a glance. The fact that inviting others to collaborate is very simple and this has made me to involve my clients or colleagues, it has given tremendous results. The numerous and amazing templates on the dashboard gives me ideas and structure to my research. Things that I used to do on paper, or excel and other programs, I now do them on this application. 
The application's dashboard in real time let's us stay connected and I like that in graphic form. You can as well tag people with certain action items on your group.
User: Though its slightly expensive application,it's really worth it.","The user appreciates Figma as a one-stop-shop for designing, planning, and delivering leadership courses, with a nearly limitless toolset and intuitive functionality. They praise its team collaboration, content visualization, and presentation capabilities. However, they note a learning curve for new users and suggest board owners lock or hide items to prevent accidental changes. Some URL links also display inconsistently when pasted."
figma,G2,"User: Miro helps me work remotely and more efficiently. It provides an online, real-time workspace for my entire team that helps us collaborate efficiently no matter where we're located.
User: My favorite thing about Miro is how it simplifies remote collaboration with its comprehensive collection of features, including collaboration, text editing, and visual effects. It has an easy learning curve that allows all users to be up and running quickly with no more than a few minutes of training. In addition, I appreciate having access to the library of pre-built templates that save me countless hours when coordinating geographically dispersed teams. These benefits make Miro an industry standard for enabling effective communication between remote workers on collaborative projects.
User: I find that the complexity of MIRO's features can make it difficult to learn, but once you understand its capabilities and features, there is no limit to the tasks you can accomplish. Although a free account does not have all the same options as a paid account - such as private boards - with careful collaboration between team members using different accounts, your project will still be successful.","Users appreciate Figma's ability to create beautiful CX artifacts and its features, usability, Miroverse, templates, and support. However, they find it pricey and suggest allowing free guest access for the first 24 hours."
figma,G2,"User: Finding the work on Miro is sometime challenging because it depends where the team members have added the work and at what % of canvas too. So why not marking the centre of the canvas for people to always start at the same point and also start at 100% always.
User: Very collaborative too, anyone can use it, smart features, well organised, extremely user friendly, the templates and the community help speed up the work and is colourful !!
User: I don't dislike much about Miro - I always find little improvements to be done such as the canvas size why not start at 100 for all the work that we add and then people can zoom in and out and the center also! like a little mark to show the centre of the canvas","Users appreciate Figma's collaborative features, easy navigation with a trackball mouse, and integration with JIRA. They also like that it's accessible for non-technical users. However, they experience issues with pasted images appearing blurry when zoomed in and would like more options for using GIFs."
figma,G2,"User: Figma allows us to produce all kinds of designs and to present them with comments. We can easily export our designs into a no code app with plugins or make a prototype. 
Figma is really handy in our daily life.
User: A quick and easy to use tool that allows many advanced features for those who want to invest in it. The collaborative aspect is great and saves a lot of time. 
Figma can be used for all types of needs.
User: The figma desktop application is not super well optimized and I often have problems with the font manager. Also, it's a shame that you can't transfer comments between different workspaces.","Users appreciate Figma's ability to quickly and easily brainstorm solutions and concepts, as well as its ease of collaboration across teams. However, they suggest adding a feature to lock items to prevent accidental movement."
figma,G2,"User: It helps me to pen down my ideas at a single place and then sorting them out and road mapping the processes I want to work on.
User: It's easy to navigate, very simple UI 
the features are clearly visible on the UI 
I use it mostly to pen down my ideas around topics 
The best part is the zoom-in and zoom-out capability.
User: So far, there is nothing to dislike. It's a great product","Users appreciate Miro for its ability to facilitate collaboration and visualization, especially during remote work situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they experience issues with slow loading times, occasional app crashes, and difficulty in using certain shapes for text input due to size and formatting limitations."
figma,G2,"User: Easy to collaborate between design team and development team.
User: We use Figma to create a design system and ot works awesome. Easy to create library, workplace and reusable projects. Easy to link various objects
User: Some tutorials and help guidelines will be beneficial","User appreciates the collaboration features, templates, and Miro AI feature for improving their design process and workflow. They also appreciate the ease of learning for new users, but find drawing lines between shapes challenging and tables clunky and hard to use."
figma,G2,"User: It helps to organize and frame work in hybrid teams. 
It engages teams working online. 
It helps you track your progress and put a lot of information in one place in a clear way.
User: It gives endless possibilities for variations of building meetings in my work (project manager). 
 
Team integration, brainstorming, or working on a lean canvas business. 
 
You can always surprise the participants of the meeting.
User: Sometimes it's a bit of fun to share a board with other participants so they can edit/vote. 
 
In the end it always works out, but the process is probably not perfect.","The user praises FigJam as a perfect collaborative whiteboarding tool, praising its powerful tools and intuitive UI. They also appreciate the real-time nature of the app and the helpful tools. However, they suggest adding a natural smoothness slider to the pen and highlighters to make it work better on trackpads."
figma,G2,"User: It is helping us create a better understanding of our processes. Different teams have different ideas on the same process, but it allows everyone to be on the same page.
User: Miro is an amazing way to collaborate with other teams. It is easy to use and very effective especially for brain storming and process/workflows.
User: I need it to be able to import/ export PowerPoints. 
not as a jpg, but to be able to modify on both. 
Presenting on Miro need is not as effective/ cant have everyone create new accounts. 
OR- Miro to make its own version of PP, that can be exported as a PP.","Users appreciate Figma's MIRO feature for active collaboration during meetings and its ability to provide a common reference space for strategic planning. They also enjoy the live collaboration and asynchronous communication capabilities. However, they suggest improving the template library to include more comprehensive examples of common business workflows."
figma,G2,"User: I use Miro for everything, it helps me to visualise and to share with my colleagues
User: - Great collaboration tool to communicate with different stakeholders and functions within and outside the comapny 
- intuitive and easy to use 
- Freemium is still comprehensive, unlike other collaboration tools
User: - Account/security hierarchy is confusing at times","Users find Miro helpful for remote collaboration, particularly in user research and Sprint Retrospectives, as it provides inbuilt templates and acts as a virtual whiteboard. However, some users find it has too many features and difficulty locking frames."
figma,G2,"User: Help to visualise UI designs and present the prototypes to visualise the product before developing. Also it helps developers to create amazing end products
User: It provides a lot of community support, which I find the best part of using Figma. 
It supports really well in animating stuff.
User: Can add a few more helpful features like repeat grid and a few others.","Users find Figma helpful for creating timelines and visualizing ecommerce demands, appreciating its intuitive and powerful features. However, they don't find the suggested templates useful, often creating their designs from scratch."
figma,G2,"User: Searchable and editable document which can be easily used.
User: Very fast way to ideate 
No extra documentation copy/digitalization 
Easier to have interactive and more engaging meetings.
User: there's no archive 
there's no way to ""obsolete"" things in the infinite board 
loading time","The user appreciates Miro as a platform for digital collaboration, facilitating hybrid work between remote and office environments. They find the tools accessible for newcomers but scale well for power users to leverage templates and tools that adapt to content and user needs across a project or workflow's stages. The user also mentions the importance of managing board sprawl and ensuring the right individuals have access to the right content in a timely manner."
figma,G2,"User: With Miro, we can brainstorm synchronously and asynchronously and further develop requirements over the entire project duration. The visualization makes the ideas clearer and easier to understand. This allows our developers to work in a more focused way.
User: Miro offers a wide range of templates. It easily creates nice looking diagrams that help you brainstorm and visualize requirements. The collaboration works really well.
User: Miro requires a good internet connection, other tools like Excalidraw are more lightweight. I miss hatched backgrounds.","Users find Miro easier to use for presentations compared to PowerPoint, appreciating its interactive and visually appealing features. However, they suggest adding filters or similar tools to improve navigation when dealing with large amounts of content on a single board."
figma,G2,"User: I can analyse data in visual form really quickly on Miro - it really helps connect the dots when you can see all of the information in one space. it is also really helpful as a collaborative tool - i no longer have to be the single scribe, everyone can contribute actively during brainstorming and it really helps with getting open feedback from stakeholders which is not often easy to do verbally. i don't think i could be without miro especially in a remote working environment.
User: Working fully remotely, Miro is my most frequently used software because there is no other tool that lets me collaborate, ideate and present information across screens more easily than Miro. I can't say that i even miss physical brainstorming boards because i no longer have to transfer handwritten notes to a digital format - it saves so much time and nothing goes missing. it's really easy to track information and review past discussions because everything is captured digitally. all of the tools and templates are very handy, i don't have to think to much about how to structure information - it's plug and play and there's so much you can do. the interface is very intuitive.
User: Miro on ipad pro could be improved to leverage the capabilities of tablets. i use miro exclusively on my computer and hardly ever on the ipad because it is very buggy and takes too long to do what i would normally do on a computer. writing is fine but it's not enough for me to also use miro on my tablet - it's a shame but i guess Freeform is a good simple and free alternative. it would also be great if Miro could be used in offline mode with an option to sync once online.","User appreciates Figma's ease of use and helpful templates but faces challenges with navigation, specifically zooming in and out. They need a way to visualize processes, organize wireframes for presentations, and document software."
figma,G2,"User: Able to quickly and easily develop design ideas while a discussion is in progress either by online team collaboration or in the meeting room with our laptops and a big screen.
User: Ease of use and assimilation for UX/UI ideation, project design, team collaboration, engineering systems maps, and diagramming my software design problems.
User: I have found nothing so far to dislike about using Miro. I have been able to easily use the tools, share, export, and print my work.","Users find Miro to be an effective virtual office for telecommuting, offering a realistic whiteboard simulation and features like sticky notes, surveys, and polls for real-time collaboration. However, they find the categorization of boards to be complicated and are seeking a better way to sort them."
figma,G2,"User: I forget about the design, about how it will look, I don't worry about graphics and focus on the processes that I am diagramming.
User: It's complete, it has a variety of diagrams that can be used to graph a process, idea or mapping.
User: I think that at this point Miro should be integrated with other platforms such as Flaticon, Dale, ChatGPT, among others.","Users appreciate Miro for its visually appealing design, ease of use, and variety of tools, such as brainstorming, polls, sticky notes, and mapping. They find it helpful for creating complex work paths and improving communication. However, some users wish for more variety in licensing options."
figma,G2,"User: I use Miro daily and it makes my work more easier and manageable. It's one of the best collaboration tool i have ever encountered. I like ease of use and the collaborative features.
User: I like how Miro enables me and my team members to easily collaborate regardless of where you are. It's a great and fantastic collaboration tool that supports great features which makes collaboration easier. It's easy to engage with teammates and use it as a mind mapping and brainstorming board application. Has the best and very helpful customer support team.
User: At the beginning, Miro can be a bit confusing especially for new users but the more you use it the easier it gets so it's not a big issue.","Users are utilizing FigJam as a retro board for evaluating weekly sprints, appreciating its ease of use and flawless real-time UI. However, they express disappointment over the removal of the mini snake game."
figma,G2,"User: I use Miro for mind maps, team whiteboard sessions, sprint and product retrospectives, collaborative wireframing with User Experience designers, and could go on with this list. It has application with a number of product management tasks.
User: I use Miro for a long list of important product management activities. It has a nice set of wireframing tools and is easy for someone who wants to sketch out ideas without using advanced design tools like Figma of Invision. I also use it to collaborate with stakeholders within the company when framing problems. The team there regularly makes product enhancements that make the tool even better.
User: The organizational structure of the tool leaves a bit to be desired. This may be user error more than anything but, sometimes, after creating several different boards on a similar topic, it's hard to organize them into a folder structure that makes it easy to find the board I'm looking for.","Users appreciate Miro for its easy navigation, customizable templates, and visually appealing interface. They find it effective for client meetings and project planning, and believe it fulfills its intended purpose without any significant weaknesses."
figma,G2,"User: Miro is very helpful especially for remote meetings and workshops as it enables simultanious collaboration of even large teams to quickly produce results for sometimes very demanding business tasks.
User: I love how easy it is to use Miro to run meetings and workshops. Using boards and clustering objects makes it very easy to clearly convey your ideas to colleagues.
User: Miro provides all the features I need when using it to collaborate with colleagues in worshops, so it is hard to say what could be better and further improved within the tool.","Users appreciate Miro for its effectiveness in facilitating brainstorming and decision-making during meetings, even when everyone is in the same room. They praise its fluidity and ease of use, allowing for real-time collaboration. However, they suggest improvements for handling unstable internet connections to ensure a seamless experience."
figma,G2,"User: Miro creates a space that everyone can drop their work into so you can see what designs are being used throughout the company without sifting through files. This saves time and makes our work day more efficient.
User: I like that you can work as a team and everyone can be on the board at the same time. It's been great for Trend Projects and presentations.
User: I do find it easier creating templates in Illustrator or InDesign. It takes a bit more time to line up artboards perfectly.","Users appreciate Figma's collaboration features, such as real-time editing and components properties, which save time and reduce miscommunication. However, they would like to see analytics for component usage in the professional plan to improve design system governance and metrics."
figma,G2,"User: I use Miro to share and keep record of a lot of the work being done by myself and my team. It helps communicate efficiently by putting everything in one place. It's an effective working place and archive of previous activities.
User: The collaboration and visibility features that are built into Miro are great. I can keep so many different formats of work in Miro, Kanban boards, user journeys, design artifacts, brainstorms, etc. and share that out with stakeholders or teammates to collab on easily.
User: So many Miro boards! I use it so much that I constantly have too many Miro tabs open in the desktop app. I wish there was a way to quickly get to the board I'm looking for, or to organize the open tabs.","Users appreciate Figma as a comprehensive platform for UX Designers, offering prototyping, flowchart creation, and collaboration features. However, they mention that it can be slow when working with large files or complex projects and has limited offline functionality."
figma,G2,"User: //
User: It s very easy to start proyects and sharing with people of your team. 
I like the base models of differents diagrams for starting use it. 
And is very easy use the plataform in general, the tools are very intuitive.
User: I cant create more than 1 team proyect if i doesnt pay. 
Some tools havent settings i would like to use","Users appreciate Figma as their go-to design tool for wireframing, prototyping, and collaboration, with the added benefit of Figjam and a robust community offering resources and plugins. However, they mention minor inconveniences such as the need for a strong internet connection, a clunky plugin handling process, and confusing navigation within the community section."
figma,G2,"User: Miro mostly helps me collaborate with my team members but I love to use it for myself too to help me plan what projects I am working on and to organize my work
User: I really love using Miro with my team to collaborate on ideas and plan for upcoming projects. I feel like it replaces a lot of other tools I used to use but is all in one. I can start a new project space just for myself and build or add in a template to help me plan something out or get an idea down. It's easy to share with teammates and use as a brainstorming board or tracking tool
User: Sometimes I think it's difficult to find the template I'm looking for so I have to try out a few different ones before deciding on one to use","User switched from Miro to Figma for brainstorming and mind maps, appreciating the variety of project management templates and collaborative tools. However, they noted that the free version only allows two work forms."
figma,G2,"User: We needed a tool to effectively whiteboard remotely and to retain the information in an easily accessible channel.
User: Miro has replaced our in-person white-boarding sessions with easy-to-use options for our marketing teams. Non-technical users pick up on the post-it style boards super quick, allowing what used to be meetings in the office to be very productive regardless of where our staff is located.
User: For new users, Miro can be overwhelming at first. Otherwise, it's been hard to think of anything that jumps out as needing improvement.","Users appreciate Miro for its usability, flexibility, and powerful tools like sticky notes, mapping, and brainstorming. It is suitable for remote teams and supports multiple devices. However, some users face challenges with navigation, particularly when zooming in and out or browsing boards with a lot of content."
figma,G2,"User: In my organisation, I used Figma to collaborate internally with the design team and build creative content templates. This helped save the designer's bandwidth and dependency too. It also acted like a Design Repository for our internal team.
User: I love the intuitive UI/UX of the tool. It is also straightforward to use, drag and drop the design elements. A lot of ready-made templates make the work effective. It is a clean and smooth tool, I would like to say!
User: I am not sure, but I guess the only thing I miss is a step-by-step guide or tips. It would be great to get pop-up tips, as everyone using the software isn't a pro designer.","Users appreciate Figma's ease of use and custom plugins for designing different layouts, but they wish for more breakpoint options and full support for tokens and modes. They also find the animation feature glitchy, causing components to revert to their original state, particularly with buttons and hover animations."
figma,G2,"User: Collaborative whiteboarding anywhere anytime
User: The ease of use and collaborative features
User: It sometimes feels a bit slow and sluggish","The user appreciates Figma for its easy-to-use whiteboard app, collaboration features, and great UX, which benefits their design team. However, they find it challenging to remember where certain features are located due to the app's extensive functionality."
figma,G2,"User: Web meetings with employees in offices far away tend to be verbal communication, but collaboration is now convenient.
User: „ÉªA very large number of boards can be easily managed 
„ÉªYou can collaborate with guest users who don't have an account 
„ÉªCooperation with Microsoft Suits is plain convenient (if you select an Excel cell and copy and paste it, it becomes a sticky note, etc.)
User: „ÉªWhen copying or exporting as a PDF or image, the appearance of the board will inevitably remain the same, so large-scale work results are too detailed to be seen. When making PDFor imaging, I want the contents of the board to be formatted without changing the meaning to make it easier to see.","The product is helping the User to organize their flows within the application, as well as providing design research and feedback templates. As a user, you appreciate that Figma is a collaborative software that can be used by your entire team. You also enjoy the ability to create designs for wireframes, brainstorming, reviews, feedback, and the 1000+ templates available. The User would like to have the ability to add more colors than those suggested to create different palettes, as well as the option to add more plugins."
