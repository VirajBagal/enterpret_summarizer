Me They ALL run INSIDE my obsdmd

googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called Electron
Electron is just a Chrome browser that runs like an app on your desktop
So essentially Obsidian  Snazzy Browser for your notes
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd This allows us  in theory  to browse any website
In practice it works 80 of the time hence I couldnt get it to work with tana_inc or logseq 
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box  with a plugin its easy Lets get to it
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Go to Settings gt Community Plugins Search for Custom Frames
Install it 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry Custom Frames towards end of your list
Find the New Frame button and click it A Frame is such a browser window that we can use to access all of the services
The new entry will appear in the list above the button 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL   or   copy amp paste from Browser
2  open in center to open the service like a tab otherwise its in the sidebar
3  Add Ribbon Icon to display a side icon 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Specify the icon you want to use
Go to  and find an icon you like
Copy paste its name into the icon textfield in previous step 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left
You will have to log in to GoogleAppleEvernote the first time But then it will remember you Just like in a browser
On the top right you find a few buttons to reload the page

image29661878 323 KB
image38961958 419 KB
When giving padding on Figma autolayout to a button the text position inside the box not the box is not in the centre height In the following example you can see that in one font type there is 2 px space at the bottom and 1 at the top and in the other one 2px at the top and 1 at the bottom
Thats led to 1 the text is not in the centre height 2 the padding is getting extra which then lead to the wrong implementation
Later on CSS the text div wont behave like that and will wrap right around the text
The ideal is that the space padding above and below the text is even and exactly as set in the padding
Is anyone have a solution for this challenge
I am having the exact same issue to the point that I thought I wrote this post  We are trying to define fonts text box behavior and autolayout for a design system so this is a serious problem

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space
Eg my Slack always open links in my work spaceprofile
Im logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces
JiriJerabek browsercompany Great question Not right now but this feature for link routing by Space is coming in a couple weeks

When I disable the Chrome Hardware acceleration I am able to open the Figma without any issue albeit slower
But when I enable the chrome hardware acceleration setting everytime I open Figma my browser will flicker once and says that my browser did not support WEBGL
Is there anyway to fix it
I need to enable the hardware acceleration for other chrome features But then I wont be able to use Figma if I do so
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files
If this is happening on a specific file then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits
Figma is a browserbased app which means its subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab including those in our Desktop App When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes
I recommend you to
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages for example by splitting a page into multiple pages will usually help with rendering performance
Hidden layers loading and then hiding a large number of layers especially in components or with images stored in them can cause a high use of available memory on loading
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here Hope it helps
Hi Celine_Doan
Its happening to all files actually
Which is weird since i can still access all files without issue if i turned the browser hardware acceleration off
i also tried using my other laptop with the hardware acceleration on to open all the files and it does not have the same issue
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Thank you for the details
Can you also ensure WebGL is enabled in Google Chrome The steps to do this are in this article 
If it is still doesnt fix your issue please reach out to the team by filling this form with all detail you recall WEBGL issue happening to all files affecting browser andor desktop etc here
Our technical team can investigate further Thank you

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a Special offer label placed inside the picture
In order to reproduce the issue
Step 1 Create a text field turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color just to create a label basically like FLASH SALE etc
Step 2 Add a rectangle and fill it with an image
Step 3 Turn both into an AutoLayout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside While doing so you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it even when the label layer is above the image
Despite that when merging a text and an image into AutoLayout and only then turning the text to AutoLayout as well to give if a fill color  this method works perfectly fine but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned so there might be a bug here Or is it

309,Notion,Twitter,"After using the AI tool for a while I ran into some issues and also found some toolsplatforms suitable for lazy people
Lets read the conclusion first I recommend the poe_platform platform The supported bots are also quite rich There are no IP requirements and if you have advanced requirements you can directly subscribe on the Poe platform
ChatGPT 
Currently I mainly use Claudes robot on the Poe platform Heres a summary of the advantages Ive discovered
1 Responses will be faster than ChatGPT in Chinese conversations
2 The corpus will be updated in due course I dont know the frequency but at least he can help me sort out the relatively new content Layer2 and Starknet
3 Writing and copywriting skills seem to be stronger than ChatGPT subjective feeling
Lets take a look at other AI tool products in detail
1chatGPT
There are strict restrictions on IP and a global proxyprivacy window must be attached to it before it can be used
There are unstable situations For example I went to WeChat to send a message to him halfway through the conversation and when I came back I had to refresh the page before I could use it
There are occasional interruptions in answering so I need to remind him to continue
In the end he blocked me which is the biggest problem with using it so far 

2Google Bard Google fought back against OpenAIs products Currently I havent been able to experience them due to IP issues so I abandoned them according to the purpose of our lazy people According to feedback from some friends there is still a certain gap between product power and ChatGPT

3Claude
The founder is the former executive vice president of OpenAI This product is very popular in the investment community Its a bit like the capital that didnt invest in Tesla back then placed a heavy bet on Lucid
Its currently completely free to use and supports use of  on Poe and Slack
4Poe
This is an integrated platform made by Quora that supports mainstream AI conversation tools GPT4 and Claude paid subscriptions are also supported
Its the best toolplatform to use so far and you can use it without having to connect to a global agent or open a ladder

5BuddyGPT
This is a GPT robot on Telegram which will be more friendly to heavy TG users Theres a free version but it only supports 10 free messages per month and the subscription costs 599month

6Defalsh
Web3 content aggregation platform with GPT as the information processing engine
There is no need to register and you can use it with authorization through the Metamask wallet Although the introduction says Web3 content aggregation platform it doesnt seem to support onchain data retrieval yet so Im still looking forward to them becoming a Web3 onestop search engine
There seems to be a plan to issue NFTs in the future which is considered a crossborder product

Ill also use Miro for other team tasks in which multiple people need to make inputs

I describe Miro as an Adobe Illustrator Group Chat I love the drag and drop flexibility of it and ease of use which allows me to capture ideas and feedback in real time Even when Im working with large groups of people the tool enables me to synthesize conversations and sharebacks in a way that captures the essence of a meeting
I have a few small feedback options for Miro 
 
1 For some reason I am forced to put a password on a board when I make it publically editable It didnt used to be like this and I find it annoying that I have to do that every time I end up just saying miroboard for everything 
 
2 When I invite outside of my org participants to join a board Via the UX they often think they have to sign up to view the board which leads to time lost in the session correcting them and getting them to the board as a guest quickly

I also love that you can take pictures of sticky notes in real life and upload them to Miro and they will turn into Miro stickies If the handwriting is hard to read then it might need to be corrected but this is still a cool feature

Using  as a perfect example created by cnnr_cllhn 
cnnr_cllhn LoseTheVery is a fantastic tool that finds a more concise adjective without using very Example very rich  affluent
The core idea is simple and the UI was chosen to reflect that Its straight to the point just like the Google Search homepage So whats the problem 
cnnr_cllhn  There are 3 main flaws
1 Site feels messy
2 Design lacks consistency
3 Elements feel a little too cramped
Well approach it via negativa style by removing stuff rather than adding
 Lets work on that that using figma
cnnr_cllhn figma 1 Decluttering 
The most important step would be to remove the clutter  the annoying newsletter popup the newsletter section and the newsletter banner Well get back to it later
This has already made a difference The interface looks significantly cleaner 
cnnr_cllhn figma 2 Let the design breathe 
Lets add more whitespace  the more the better This will achieve a better visual separation
Now the very  x  y line instantly grabs our attention 
cnnr_cllhn figma 3 Making buttons prettier 
Buttons look chaotic here randomly spaced different padding etc
Lets increase the font size adjust the padding and replace the word random with a dice icon Well also invert the third button
The buttons now look modern and consistent

Make it interactive from prototype tab
Create a component set

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped

Its a tool that can do a ton of things well and helps make visuals much easier to consume vs a document
3 Looker
Weve used Looker for several years and its our goto spot for building reports and dashboards
Our core team dashboard and pricingconversion dashboards both live here and I check each daily
4 Amplitude_HQ 
For product analytics we use Amplitude Looker gives me highlevel business metrics Amplitude gives me the details
We use this for understanding the user behavior behind the metrics
5 CrazyEgg amp hotjar 
Two tools that do similar things we use one for our website and one for our app
These give us even more qualitative data behind our metrics with things like heat maps and screen recordings
6 SlackHQ 
I barely use email any more and while the Slack overload is real it does enable fast async communication among our teams wherever we are
Its also great for consolidating notifications from other tools Asana Google Docs etc if you set up the integrations
7 Officevibe 
Our HR team implemented this tool and as PM it gives me a bunch of metrics about how my team is doing
It gives me some data backing for how the team is feeling and shows me when I might need to spend time on morale

I honestly cannot rate Miro highly enough It has become an essential part of remote working for me since I was introduced to it in 2020 and one of the most advanced whiteboard tools I have come across 
 
In my current role as a UX Researcher I use Miro for facilitating workshops and analysing and synthesising research I can dedicate an entire board to a research project and give stakeholders a space that they can refer back to at any time I also embed my project boards in our internal Confluence pages which allows my colleagues to interact with the board without having to leave the page 
 
Other features I find useful are 
 The vast amount of templates available 
 Giving presentations directly from Miro 
 The addition of a private mode 
 Show author on stickies 
 Im really excited to try the new talkback feature 
 
Its very intuitive to use so the barrier for entry is extremely low I often lead workshops with people that arent very technical and seldom have any issues with people trying to learn how to use Miros features
Exporting stickies to CSV format with the columns and rows in the correct order can be a bit fiddly I have to manually separate columns into rows whilst trying to maintain the integrity of the data Perhaps there could beis a way to tabulate stickies in bulk within Miro but I havent found an easy way to do this yet

like if youre in Figmahell and youre googling how to get this file fixed the last thing you need is some bullshit SEOgaming glossover article with 3 steps explaining how to click on layers and delete them 
not on my blog nope
 how to make a wicked strategic action plan and target the most gnarly parts of your file first
 
 multiple plugins most are free you can leverage to speed up this work
whole post is designed to get you back to a safe amount of memory usage as quickly as possible
i spent all day on this and need to let it simmer and do a round of editing later but im really excited to put this out in the world first blog post of 2023 is 
shout out to gleb_sexy and sedatcak  youve each inspired and facilitated this post in a big way 
the editing hat is on  heres a teaser outline of this soontolaunch blog post
 Milestone 1 Develop a plan of attack
 Prepare your detective notes
 Find the highest concentration of layers
 cont
 Milestone 2 Reduce as many layers as possible
 Remove draft material
 Remove unnecessary hidden layers from regular frames
 Remove all unnecessary hidden layers from main components in your local file
 cont
 Milestone 3 Reduce variant count
 Introduce exposed nested instances
 Eliminate fauxrepeater properties in favor of using  content carriers
 Consider divesting from variants altogether 
 cont
 Milestone 4 Compress images 
 Leverage the Downsize plugin and ImageOptim
 Milestone 5 Simplify complex vectors

You have several ways
Users will create their own personal access tokens which will be inserted into the input field of your plugin
Users will open the necessary library files run the plugin there to get the necessary keys return to another file to continue working
Hardcode the keys in the plugin

There is an interesting concept in Figma thats used and was presented by multiple people and has different names Placeholder Slots Dummies Layout Blocks and so on
 Placeholder component is the base one
 Placeholder instances may be nested into another  Component
 Placeholder instances nested into  Component instances may be swapped with any other component instances
More details in this video by Adam_RuthendorfPrzewoski
The next step of its evolution is Layout Blocks by MrBiscuit
An issue
I have a base  Placeholder component
 Placeholder instances may be nested into other components  Column here
image2080384 854 KB
What I need is to nest a  Column instance into another  Column instance by swapping one of the  Placeholders
This is needed to customize Auto Layout spacings and other properties
image804564 843 KB
But when I try to do this I see an error message Failed to set component cycle detected
I totally understand why were not allowed to nest instances into their Main components  it will create an endless cycle such as infinite screen share
image1600808 102 KB
But actually it is not endless  we always will have the last one  Placeholder instance as a stop point
image804932 114 KB
My Demo file to better understand whats going on
Possible solutions
There are a couple of solutions that solve this issue but still are not optimal
Have multiple absolutely identical components to nest one into another
image15681242 223 KB
For the upperlevel use a component with more placeholders inside and hide unnecessary ones
image1092644 123 KB

I think the only solution for now is to create a  Main Container component with  slot instances inside Then you need to create also another component for  ColumnRow with variants With this you can upto 2nd level only Unless yo create a similar column component with different name

Step 1
Create a new artboard and add a rectangle with a grey fill 
Step 2
Go into vector edit mode and select 2 anchor points Manipulate those till you get an angle you like 
Step 3
Repeat the first 2 steps and make sure to connect each begin of a fold with the end points of the previous one 
Step 4 
Step 5
Time for some color Create a linear gradient going from light to dark and copy amp paste the style to your vectors OPTCMDC gt OPTCMDV
Tip Use more than 2 color stops in your gradient for a unique look 
Step 6
Nice Now we just have to change the gradient angles for every other vector to create more realistic lighting 
Step 7
To take your gradient fold to the next level introduce some extra color combinations 
Bonus Step
You can try to go for a top and bottom gradient effect as shown below 
Okay one more bonus step
You can even try to split up a larger gradient in multiple stops to create an effect like shown below

FigJams simplicity and ease of use enables fast mapping and sharing of complex systems and dependencies Ive recently created several sprawling figjam charts that outline marketing programs from beginning to end for our clients They have been so helpful keeping the team informed at a high level and are a great reference to regularly huddle around 
 
This is just one kind of use  because of its flexibility you can begin to discover ways to think and present ideas large or small Create fast design mockups review and provide feedback on designs create storyboards  the list can go on and on Easily shareable to anyone with little to no trouble with login attempts or dealing with incompatible file types 
 
It feels so freeing to break from the clunky confines of a ppt slide with its bad clip art and boring bullet points Expanding across an endless canvas allows us to combat any confusion or anxiety that tends to show up around building complex marketing campaigns 
 
Figjam has become one the most valuable tools in my arsenal and is one of the best Ive seen after almost 2 decades of working with these types of apps

The DLS and the the first App will be created as two separate design files within the same project My hope was that at various intervals I would be able to copy and paste content from the App into the DLS then publish the library from the DLS and get the other team to use the library swap feature to swap their local components with those from the DLS published library
But my initial tests lead me to believe that this isnt possible It seems that you can only use library swap on two externally published libraries rather than an external library the DLS and a local library the App Is this the case
If so what is the suggested workflow in this situation

Having a design system where standards are defined and designers can jointly contribute components
These components would be based on the core styling of that design system 
This would also include improvements to accessibility guidelines and improvements in documentation
In turn anyone can use these components either as they are or make slight adjustments
I think figma already has a foundation to enable this  however it needs to be defined
Having an actively maintained DS in the public domain Not tied to any organization
Anyone can pick it up and suggest improvements

Describe the problem your experiencing and how your idea helps solve this
When you create an autolayout frame it always defaults to 10px Many design systems call for an 8px grid and in many cases users dont want ANY padding especially where edgetoedge designs are concerned
Ask questions to bring the community into the conversation
What are everyones thoughts about the following solutions
Default autolayout padding based on the big nudge amount in your settings
Allow for tokenization of paddingmargin grids and offer up autolayout parameters based upon those tokens
Allow users to override the padding to 0px at the creation of the autolayout frame by using an alternative key command like ctrlshifta command on mac

Fastest way I found to apply auto layout with 0 paddings

Actually even faster Select object  cmdG  shiftA "," User experiences issues with Figma's scale tool, as it reverts the scaled component to its original size upon clicking the instance, and undoing does not fix the issue.

My app says I am a subscribed member so why is it denying me member benefits I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone restarting the app deleting and downloading the app again logging out and then back in etc Nothing has worked so far Not only do I feel robbed but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses but after subscribing it sends me straight to the subscription choice page That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it regardless of if that is actually the case or not Looking through some of the other lower reviews I am not the only one who has ran into this problem Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for

Our question is if does exist an official way to work with different versions in the same file in order to handle versioning or if there is a better way to do this
Example of what we need
Button v1 branch main
a new feature for Button v1 a new branch from the main branch
Button v2 branch version 2 branch
a new feature for Button v2 a new branch from version 2 branch

Miro is easier to use than an actual whiteboard In particular its easy to attach write move and connect sticky notes and it automatically corrects the connection lines so you can use it more efficiently than an actual whiteboard So you can focus on the discussion Also miro is great for sharing information you create online ensuring that the same image information is conveyed As a comparison to other similar tools its nice to have reaction features icons and formatting that you cant use up
The disadvantage of miro is that the access can be quite slow depending on the board When you first open a board with a lot of information on it you often have to wait a few 10 seconds I hope that this problem will be solved by devising means such as image processing centered on the area where the display priority is being determined Also if you just use it you dont have a chance to see new or useful functions so I think it would be good if you were shown it by a popup This feature may already exist and you may have turned it off yourself but it is true that it does not appear at this time","The user appreciates Figma for its ease of use in remote and hybrid teams, allowing for asynchronous problem-solving and accessible designs.

4087,figma,Twitter,"Ive been a designer for a little over 13 years Early in my design career I started feeling like I wanted a more technical role and switched to frontend development
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for me
At the time I was building custom WordPress themes 
Within my theme Id have a partials folder full of my silly little components
And I had my templates folder full of my silly little templates
Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular maintainable and organised template files
Seeing it all come together was a huge aha moment for me but I didnt know why  at the time design systems wasnt a wellknown concept
I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass extending classes using mixins and all that fun CSS goodness

Looking back at it now I realise that what I was really kind of doing was implementing a simplified version of component properties
Code felt natural and intuitive  I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly But design tooling wasnt anywhere close to what it is now
Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying pasting and replacing The process felt outdated and ineffective and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code even the tiniest bit
When I learned about Figma a few years later it felt like a huge weight had been lifted and my passion for design exploded
Im so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly and some of the gaps between designdev are starting to thin out
This was a lot of tweets about nothing but I woke up feeling so in love with my career 
And just generally grateful that I get to sit around all day working on design systems architecting components crafting design patterns and collaborating with developers 
I dont think Id be so passionate about my career if figma didnt come around when it did  Its setting the standard of things to come and were only at the beginning ","The user has published a new version of the #pagger in the @figma community, which now allows users to assign tags, prevents the state of the pages from being shared between accounts, and allows users to test it as long as they want (not in the same file).",404,48,0.1188118811881188,-0.019589129835367203

The core idea is simple and the UI was chosen to reflect that Its straight to the point just like the Google Search homepage So whats the problem 
cnnr_cllhn  There are 3 main flaws
1 Site feels messy
2 Design lacks consistency
3 Elements feel a little too cramped
Well approach it via negativa style by removing stuff rather than adding
 Lets work on that that using figma
cnnr_cllhn figma 1 Decluttering 
The most important step would be to remove the clutter  the annoying newsletter popup the newsletter section and the newsletter banner Well get back to it later
This has already made a difference The interface looks significantly cleaner 
cnnr_cllhn figma 2 Let the design breathe 
Lets add more whitespace  the more the better This will achieve a better visual separation
Now the very  x  y line instantly grabs our attention

In general I like the whiteboarding and mapping capabilities that allow for deep thought process documentation and pure collaboration with teams It allows me to jot my rough thoughts on paper where I then can find patterns and create a more solid process Miro is the perfect think tank environment that you use from start ideation to a finish a solid concept Its also great for inviting colleagues for feedback or collaboration Anyone can use it with a free license
Miroboards have a size capacity where if you add too many screenshots it starts to slow down It can also get extremely messy and often confusing for a new user coming in and unsure where to start Sometimes if you start your miroboard too big the details of things like adding arrow connectors can be really tiny Causing me to selecting all and sizing down my space so you can see these details I sometimes run into issues with font formatting if I copied and pasted a highlighted text in bold and then I drag in the text widget it will copy what Ive used when that is not my intention Its really just the small details that I wish were fixed that could make my experience more easier",The user appreciates Figma's ease in creating whiteboards for moodboards and presentations but finds it challenging to locate options for adding links or importing images and creating clipping masks.,407,29,0.07125307125307126,0.27261555194854736

And the intelligent and underrated use of YouTube for a business 
Its particularity He chose as a social network to express himself YouTube Uncommon
Concretely browsercompany has a channel with 20k subscribers and 2 types of videos
 the culture and vision of the company
 tutorials and advice for its users
 
We will mainly focus on the first category the one in which joshm is personally involved
In terms of form these videos are YouTubefriendly that is to say
 exclusive no balanced body videos on all channels
 1020 minutes
 with a chapter
There are 2 formats that I particularly like
1 its QA in early 2023 to report and answer for example the question of its business model with embedded graphs and dataviz 72k views 3rd channel video
 
What is interesting is that this video starts from a tweet that he posted in early December just before the 2nd meeting of the browsercompany board with the desire to be transparent and accountable to his users build in public

And hey presto 2 weeks later he answers it in this famous video

2 A video where he films himself in a photo booth from his Mac desktop which allows him to browse his Finder and show content images sounds videos etc by unfolding his story Funny with a touch of brothelartisan
 
This format was called videofile_ and allows browsercompany to tell its new features and the philosophy behind each time being embodied by an employee not just the CEO And given the engagement rates thats interesting 
2 other videos that were a hit  a metavideo where the CEO watches and reacts to a review of his browser by one of the biggest tech influencers MKBHD Its THE most popular video with 343K views Skilled at surfing on his visibility

 a vlog with members of the browsercompany board who clearly plays the behindthescenes strategicmeetingsthatnotsoseetosee card the kind of content that always works

I know that Figma objects dont care about the scale in the relativeTransform and have to be resized using resize How do I adjust the transform to remove the scale but keep the correct rotation and especially skew
In this picture I first scale then rotate the points are transformed correctly the rectangle and star are not 
Here first I rotate then scale
Here is skew If thats all I do it works
but as soon as I rotate the result the objects and points do different things the points are correct
So if I take an identity matrix and apply a bunch of transforms to it how do I translate the final result to Figma objects
Oh yes Ive seen it when it was just released it evolved quite a lot Amazing work
