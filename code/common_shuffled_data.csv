Miro's range of templates, diagrams, and sticky notes make it easy to share ideas visually, which can be especially helpful for projects that require a lot of detail or complexity. This has allowed me to communicate my ideas more effectively with my team members, resulting in better collaboration and a more efficient workflow.
User: I have found Miro to be an incredibly powerful tool for collaborating with teams. One of the things I like best about Miro is how easy it is to use. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it simple to get started even for those who are not particularly tech-savvy. 
The real-time collaboration features in Miro are also incredibly helpful. Multiple team members can work on a board simultaneously, which helps to streamline the collaborative process and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features, such as templates, sticky notes, and diagrams, are highly customizable, allowing for greater flexibility when working on projects.
User: One thing that I have found to be a drawback of Miro is its pricing structure. While the platform offers a free plan, its more advanced features are only available with paid plans, which may be expensive for smaller teams or individuals. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users, and it may take some time to learn how to use everything effectively.

What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay

Learn how to create this folded gradient effect with @figma, in just a few easy steps ‚Äî no plugins needed.
Ready? Let‚Äôs dive in üëá
#sponsored <STRICT_LINK>
User: Step 1
Create a new artboard and add a rectangle with a grey fill <STRICT_LINK>
User: Step 2 
Go into vector edit mode and select 2 anchor points. Manipulate those till you get an angle you like <STRICT_LINK>
User: Step 3 
Repeat the first 2 steps and make sure to connect each begin of a fold with the end points of the previous one <STRICT_LINK>
User: Step 4
Finish your composition, make sure to create artboard copies for different iterations! <STRICT_LINK>
User: Step 5 
Time for some color! Create a linear gradient going from light to dark, and copy &amp; paste the style to your vectors. (OPT+CMD+C -&gt; OPT+CMD+V) 
Tip: Use more than 2 color stops in your gradient for a unique look! <STRICT_LINK>
User: Step 6 
Nice! Now we just have to change the gradient angles for every other vector to create more realistic lighting <STRICT_LINK>
User: Step 7 
To take your gradient fold to the next level, introduce some extra color combinations! <STRICT_LINK>
User: Bonus Step 
You can try to go for a top and bottom gradient effect as shown below... <STRICT_LINK>
User: Okay one more bonus step. 
You can even try to split up a larger gradient in multiple stops to create an effect like shown below. 
No matter what you do, make sure to experiment and have fun! <STRICT_LINK>

(Giveaway at the end) <STRICT_LINK>
User: 2/12 First up, we use @NotionHQ . It's our hub for everything. Tasks, deadlines, management ‚Äì it's all there. It works like a charm to keep everything organised, especially when working when a team it‚Äôs nice, since everyone knows what‚Äôs where.
User: 3/12 Next, Slack. We use this mainly for internal communication with the team and for communication with a few clients. In the beginning we wanted to use Slack 100% for clients communication, but some clients just don‚Äôt like it, and we don‚Äôt want to force them haha.
User: 4/12 We also use Monday, it's our CRM where we track leads and conversions, basically keeping our clients in the loop. We used to do this in Notion, but it was hard to use which made it less motivating to keep it up to date.
User: 5/12 @zapier is our go-to for automation. It takes care of all the repeat stuff, so we have more time to be creative. Nothing special, but is saves a lot of time.
User: 6/12 For crafting copy we use @OpenAI's ChatGPT. Before GPT released we were actually using a tool called Jasper a year ago, it was around 100USD a month and delivered 30% of the results GPT offers for free, a real game changer.
User: 7/12 @webflow is the platform we use to built our website with, which integrates seamlessly with all our other tools through Zapier.
User: 8/12 For designs, we're all about @figma, from UI designs to logos, it's our go-to for making visuals."," User shares their plan to write a case study on their personal website, showcasing their design ideas and implementation process.

531,figma,G2,"User: Miro has the power to aggregate what has been shared among multiple tools. In addition, it has the potential to allow multiple people to work at the same time without any problems, and it has been used in seminars and training sessions, and has been very popular. In the training that I participate in, training using miro is increasing, and it is very useful to visualize the result of the discussion in a short time.
User: Miro is easier to use than an actual whiteboard. In particular, it's easy to attach, write, move, and connect sticky notes, and it automatically corrects the connection lines, so you can use it more efficiently than an actual whiteboard. So you can focus on the discussion. Also, miro is great for sharing information you create online, ensuring that the same image information is conveyed. As a comparison to other similar tools, it's nice to have reaction features, icons, and formatting that you can't use up.
User: The disadvantage of miro is that the access can be quite slow depending on the board. When you first open a board with a lot of information on it, you often have to wait a few 10 seconds. I hope that this problem will be solved by devising means such as image processing centered on the area where the display priority is being determined.

615,Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: This review is more about Notion itself than the app. After reviewing a bunch of other programs I subscribed to Notion to help build my new businesses internal infrastructure. I was happy at first but it seems that the moment anything goes wrong Notion support is less than helpful. I‚Äôve been going back and forth with Notion support trying to fix some billing issues (updating my payment details). Notion seems fairly incapable of actually troubleshooting the problem and at this point as I keep getting the same suggestions from different ‚Äòpeople‚Äô I‚Äôm convinced Notion help is running on AI and not an actual human with problem solving skills. Despite numerous occasions saying the system won‚Äôt let me update my payment details and suggesting an actual bug that may be causing the issues their reply was: It‚Äôs so easy, you don‚Äôt even have to log in. Please update your information with this link. Also to note, you only get a reply every 24 hours, so after every (it‚Äôs so simple update your info) communication gets a bit tiresome. If you‚Äôve seen Sh*+s creek this whole exchange was the equivalent of ‚Äújust fold in the cheese - what do you mean - it‚Äôs easy, you just fold in the cheese‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried to escalate this to a dept manager or someone in tech that would hopefully have the skills beyond ‚Äúit‚Äôs so easy just update your information‚Äù however the more frustrated I get the less inclined they seem to be to help me. It‚Äôs at the point where I‚Äôm considering switching to another service which will be a hard decision seeing as we have put a lot of time into building our systems in Notion. Also to note despite being told that the old payment info is incorrect and I cannot update my payment details they continue to attempt to bill the old card number and then send me warnings that I need to update my information. So, let this be a cautionary tale for anyone using Notion for their business - it‚Äôs good, until it‚Äôs not. At which point you better be able to problem solve on your own.

User: I like the ease of use with Miro. It's possible to collaborate with colleagues quickly. My favorite feature is the Microsoft Teams integration. With Miro and other whiteboarding tools, we always had issues trying to share editing access on boards, but now that we can embed the boards in Teams, anyone on the call can have access and edit the board, even if they aren't an employee at our company. It honestly has been a game changer for us when we do workshops or user interviews. I also like the single sign on option. It makes getting into Miro much easier and I don't have to enter my password. 
 
I also love that you can take pictures of sticky notes in real life and upload them to Miro and they will turn into Miro stickies. If the handwriting is hard to read, then it might need to be corrected, but this is still a cool feature.

- with a chapter

User: What I like about Figjam is that it's easy to use and provides some templates (with instructions) so that teams can get onboarded quickly and start collaborating. I've used Figjam with other designers and also with non-design/tech team members, and we've benefitted tremendously from using Figjam as a fun collaboration tool.
User: While I like that Figjam provides basic tools for brainstorming and real-time collaboration, I sometimes find it can be too limiting. I wish there were more customization options related to shapes, colours, and fonts, so that my teammates and I can explore crude wireframes that are just a little more detailed than the rounded rectangles and other shapes that Figjam allows.

762,figma,G2,"User: This is my #1 choice of tool when collaborating with clients. My team uses Miro to document a strategy or wireframe and collect client feedback in real-time, it helps ensure the client that we are listening to their wants and needs. Instead of using a static PPT where we are just jotting down the notes, clients can see the work in action. In addition, we use the Miro board to document processes and attach key artifacts and URLS. This process documentation is exhaustive but Miro allows users to zoom in and out from a micro/macro view to learn about the process which is great for leadership to see and great for onboarding. It especially works for a global remote company where we can all jump in to review no matter the time zone. If you are in the same time zone, it works great to get everyone in the room and use as a collaboration tool. For example, I'm located in California and my client is located in the UK. We use miro to make updates on our timezone and get very detailed in specific areas of question. It allows for transparency, review, and collaboration.
User: In general, I like the whiteboarding and mapping capabilities that allow for deep thought, process documentation, and pure collaboration with teams. It allows me to jot my rough thoughts on paper where I then can find patterns and create a more solid process. Miro is the perfect think tank environment that you use from start (ideation) to a finish (a solid concept). It's also great for inviting colleagues for feedback or collaboration. Anyone can use it with a free license.
User: Miroboards have a size capacity where if you add too many screenshots, it starts to slow down. It can also get extremely messy and often confusing for a new user coming in and unsure where to start. Sometimes if you start your miroboard too big, the details of things like adding arrow connectors can be really tiny. Causing me to selecting all and sizing down my space so you can see these details. I sometimes run into issues with font formatting, if I copied and pasted a highlighted text in bold and then I drag in the text widget, it will copy what I've used when that is not my intention. It's really just the small details that I wish were fixed that could make my experience more easier.",The user appreciates Figma's ease in creating whiteboards for moodboards and presentations but finds it challenging to locate options for adding links or importing images and creating clipping masks.,407,29,0.07125307125307126,0.26704472303390503

2. When I invite outside of my org participants to join a board. Via the UX they often think they have to sign up to view the board, which leads to time lost in the session correcting them and getting them to the board as a guest quickly.

1105,figma,G2,"User: Being able to collaborate with colleagues in a virtual space is fundamental for remote working. It has also made my research activities easier to manage and more accessible within the business. From team building sessions, retrospectives, or working solo - it honestly is a game changer and I can't imagine how we would manage without it.
User: I honestly cannot rate Miro highly enough. It has become an essential part of remote working for me since I was introduced to it in 2020, and one of the most advanced whiteboard tools I have come across. 
 
In my current role as a UX Researcher, I use Miro for facilitating workshops and analysing and synthesising research. I can dedicate an entire board to a research project and give stakeholders a space that they can refer back to at any time. I also embed my project boards in our internal Confluence pages, which allows my colleagues to interact with the board without having to leave the page. 
 
Other features I find useful are: 
- The vast amount of templates available 
- Giving presentations directly from Miro 
- The addition of a private mode 
- 'Show author' on stickies 
- I'm really excited to try the new 'talkback' feature! 
 
It's very intuitive to use so the barrier for entry is extremely low. I often lead workshops with people that aren't very technical and seldom have any issues with people trying to learn how to use Miro's features.
User: Exporting stickies to CSV format with the columns and rows in the correct order can be a bit fiddly. I have to manually separate columns into rows whilst trying to maintain the integrity of the data. Perhaps there could be/is a way to tabulate stickies in bulk within Miro but I haven't found an easy way to do this yet. 
 
I often run out of sticky note colours and would really like to be able to use my own custom colours like you can with frames and shapes. I would love some more themes for diagramming and flow charts, or the ability to save a set of custom colours as a theme for diagramming shapes.","Users appreciate Figma's seamless collaboration experience across multiple regions, especially for project kick-offs and workshops.

User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd This allows us - in theory - to browse any website.
(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""
Install it. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry ""Custom Frames"" (towards end of your list)

The new entry will appear in the list above the button. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL (<STRICT_LINK>, <STRICT_LINK> or <STRICT_LINK> - copy &amp; paste from Browser)

3 ‚úÖ ""Add Ribbon Icon"" to display a side icon. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Specify the icon you want to use.

Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left.

On the top right you find a few buttons, to reload the page. <STRICT_LINK>

1185,figma,Twitter,"User: Trying to apply several transformations in a row to a Figma object, including skew, and keeping the full working matrix (with correct scale values), how do I apply the final composite transformation?
I know that Figma objects don‚Äôt care about the scale in the relativeTransform and have to be resized using resize(). How do I adjust the transform to ‚Äúremove‚Äù the scale but keep the correct rotation and especially skew?
In this picture I first scale then rotate, the points are transformed correctly, the rectangle and star are not. 
Here first I rotate then scale:
Here is skew. If that‚Äôs all I do, it works:
but as soon as I rotate the result, the objects and points do different things (the points are correct):
So, if I take an identity matrix and apply a bunch of transforms to it, how do I translate the final result to Figma objects?
User: Oh yes I‚Äôve seen it when it was just released, it evolved quite a lot! Amazing work!
I‚Äôve shared this post in the Figma Discord for visibility, hopefully someone can help.

As a single person, notion is completely free with next to no restrictions. Teams will require payment, but it has a free trial to see how you like it, and I consider it fantastic for groups. However, that being said, mobile notion is severely lacking in certain features that the desktop version has. Basic features like renaming your workspace can only be done on desktop. There are also some bugs with the ui, like the back arrow sometimes just straight up sending me out of the current workspace, and the toolbar disappearing and requiring me to restart the app.
These don‚Äôt ruin the app by any means, as notion is still an amazing app and is still amazing in mobile, but I would consider mobile notion a great ADDITION to your desktop notion. Use desktop as your main form of using notion when creating, and use mobile when you‚Äôre away from the desktop or need to check something. Mobile as your only form of using notion isn‚Äôt terrible, but it‚Äôs definitely inferior.

Describe the problem your experiencing and how your idea helps solve this
When you create an autolayout frame, it always defaults to 10px. Many design systems call for an 8px grid and in many cases, users don‚Äôt want ANY padding especially where edge-to-edge designs are concerned.
Ask questions to bring the community into the conversation
What are everyone‚Äôs thoughts about the following solutions?:
Default autolayout padding based on the big nudge amount in your settings
Allow for tokenization of padding/margin grids and offer up autolayout parameters based upon those tokens
Allow users to override the padding to 0px at the creation of the autolayout frame by using an alternative key command like ctrl+shift+a (command on mac)

1564,Notion,Twitter,"User: People often ask me for good examples of executive communication: let's talk about @joshm, the CEO of @browsercompany. ‚Üì
(And the intelligent and underrated use of YouTube for a business) <STRICT_LINK>
User: Its particularity? He chose as a social network to express himself... YouTube. Uncommon.
Concretely, @browsercompany has a channel with 20k subscribers and 2 types of videos:
- the culture and vision of the company
- tutorials and advice for its users
<STRICT_LINK> <STRICT_LINK>
User: We will mainly focus on the first category, the one in which @joshm is personally involved.
In terms of form, these videos are YouTube-friendly, that is to say:
- exclusive (no balanced body videos on all channels)
- 10-20 minutes
- with a chapter
User: There are 2 formats that I particularly like:
1) its Q&A in early 2023 to report and answer, for example, the question of its business model... with embedded graphs and dataviz. 72k views, 3rd channel video.
<STRICT_LINK> <STRICT_LINK>
User: What is interesting is that this video starts from a tweet that he posted in early December, just before the 2nd meeting of the @browsercompany board... with the desire to be transparent and accountable to his users (‚Äúbuild in public‚Äù).
<STRICT_LINK>
User: And, hey presto, 2 weeks later, he answers it in this famous video:
<STRICT_LINK>
User: 2) A video where he films himself in a photo booth from his Mac desktop... which allows him to browse his Finder and show content (images, sounds, videos, etc.) by unfolding his story. Funny, with a touch of brothel/artisan.
<STRICT_LINK> <STRICT_LINK>
User: This format was called ‚Äúvideofile_‚Äù and allows @browsercompany to ‚Äútell‚Äù its new features and the ‚Äúphilosophy behind‚Äù, each time being embodied by an employee (not just the CEO). And given the engagement rates, that's interesting. <STRICT_LINK>
User: 2 other videos that were a hit: - a ‚Äúmeta-video‚Äù where the CEO watches and reacts to a review of his browser by one of the biggest tech influencers, MKBHD. It's THE most popular video with 343K views. Skilled at surfing on his visibility.
<STRICT_LINK>
User: - a vlog with members of the @browsercompany board who clearly plays the ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes strategic-meetings-that-not-so-see-to-see‚Äù card: the kind of content that always works. <STRICT_LINK>

User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd This allows us - in theory - to browse any website.
(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""
Install it. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry ""Custom Frames"" (towards end of your list)
Find the ""New Frame"" button and click it. A Frame is such a browser window, that we can use to access all of the services.
The new entry will appear in the list above the button. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL (<STRICT_LINK>, <STRICT_LINK> or <STRICT_LINK> - copy &amp; paste from Browser)
2 ‚úÖ ""open in center"" to open the service like a tab (otherwise it's in the sidebar)
3 ‚úÖ ""Add Ribbon Icon"" to display a side icon. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Specify the icon you want to use.
Go to <STRICT_LINK> and find an icon you like.
Copy paste it's name into the ""icon"" textfield in previous step. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left.
You will have to log in to Google/Apple/Evernote/... the first time. But then it will remember you. (Just like in a browser)
On the top right you find a few buttons, to reload the page. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Summary:

Using Miro goes beyond the pre-sales process, as it also helps to diagram implementation processes, identifying the various technical and human aspects of the equation. 
 
While words go a long way, making a diagram and showing processes step-by-step make operations functional in my line of work. It's also great to build business plans for teams, as it allows everyone to collaborate without the hindrance of size limitations in a presentation or a document.
User: Miro provides an all-hands approach to workflow design, where my team can not only collaborate and operate effectively, but I can also work my way through various business, marketing, and sales demands.

1734,figma,Twitter,"User: Hi all, I am working on a Figma plugin that needs to import style from our team library. Through research I think the way is to first use Figma REST API to get the keys of styles from our library file, and the use figma.importStyleByKeyAsync() to import the style. However, the issue is, this requires me to put my Access token in the plugin, and I don‚Äôt want to. Is there a way for plugin to authenticate when making REST API calls on behalf of the person who uses the plugin?
Or are there any other easier ways to import/access styles from team library file in plugin? Thanks a lot!!!
User: You have several ways:
Users will create their own personal access tokens, which will be inserted into the input field of your plugin.
Users will open the necessary library files, run the plugin there to get the necessary keys, return to another file to continue working.
Hardcode the keys in the plugin.
3.1. Or add these keys to, for example, a JSON file that you or anyone else can keep updating as needed.

User: Hi, thanks for the reply! I see, I will give option 3 a try, to hard code the keys in the plugin, and keep the plugin for internal use first. The other ways seem to have some extra steps for people who uses plugin.","Users are experiencing issues with Figma, where component instances do not update properly when there's a color change in main components.

Two tools that do similar things: we use one for our website and one for our app.
These give us even more qualitative data behind our metrics, with things like heat maps and screen recordings.
User: 6. @SlackHQ 
I barely use email any more, and while the Slack overload is real, it does enable fast async communication among our teams, wherever we are.
It's also great for consolidating notifications from other tools (Asana, Google Docs, etc.) if you set up the integrations.

The DLS and the the first App will be created as two separate design files within the same project. My hope was that at various intervals I would be able to copy and paste content from the App into the DLS then publish the library from the DLS and get the other team to use the library swap feature to swap their local components with those from the DLS published library.
But my initial tests lead me to believe that this isn‚Äôt possible. It seems that you can only use library swap on two externally published libraries rather than an external library (the DLS) and a local library (the App). Is this the case?
If so, what is the suggested workflow in this situation?

image2966√ó1878 323 KB
image3896√ó1958 419 KB
When giving ‚Äúpadding‚Äù on Figma auto-layout to a button, the text position (inside the box, not the box) is not in the centre height. In the following example, you can see that in one font type there is 2 px space at the bottom and 1 at the top and in the other one, 2px at the top and 1 at the bottom.
That‚Äôs led to; 1, the text is not in the centre height, 2, the padding is getting extra which then lead to the wrong implementation.
Later on CSS, the text div won‚Äôt behave like that and will wrap right around the text.
The ideal is that the space (padding) above and below the text is even and exactly as set in the padding.
Is anyone have a solution for this challenge?
User: I am having the exact same issue (to the point that I thought I wrote this post ) We are trying to define fonts, text box behavior, and auto-layout for a design system, so this is a serious problem.

It's great that it allows me to quickly spin up a board and hammer out visual concepts quickly and I'd happily use this to create UR artifacts, but it has some drawbacks and I wouldn't be able to facilitate some activities.
User: Figjam is a great tool that fulfills a lot of the functionality you get in more advanced whiteboard apps and does more or less a good job of it. The ability to deep-link to elements in a board, and make sections and post-its, is fine and works pretty well.
User: There could be more functionality to format and resize post-its. It'd also be really helpful, for the facilitation of workshop activities, to be able to show and hide sections. this would ideally be on a user or for users or user groups.

It provides a centralized platform for product managers to collaborate with their team members and stakeholders, regardless of their location. Miro's digital whiteboard allows product managers to brainstorm and ideate with their team, visually organize their ideas, and prioritize their tasks. It also helps product managers manage their projects effectively, create and manage product roadmaps, user story maps, and agile and Scrum methodologies.
User: Miro is an excellent tool for collaborating and brainstorming with teams remotely. Its vast canvas space, extensive library of pre-made templates, and user-friendly interface make it easy to create and share ideas visually. I particularly like its real-time collaboration feature which allows team members to work together seamlessly, regardless of their location.

2649,figma,Twitter,"User: We want to start using versioning in our projects and we are trying to figure out the best way to do it.
The approach that makes more sense to us is to create a new branch on each file for the new version.
Our issue is that we have team members working on each version (1 and 2) but we can‚Äôt create a new feature branch for the version 2 branch (we don‚Äôt have this issue for version 1 because that is the main branch).
Our question is if does exist an official way to work with different versions in the same file in order to handle versioning or if there is a better way to do this.
Example of what we need
Button v1 branch (main)
a new feature for Button v1 (a new branch from the main branch)
Button v2 branch (version 2 branch)
a new feature for Button v2 (a new branch from version 2 branch)

There is an interesting concept in Figma that‚Äôs used and was presented by multiple people and has different names: Placeholder, Slots, Dummies, Layout Blocks, and so on:
‚ùñ Placeholder component is the base one.
‚óá Placeholder instances may be nested into another ‚ùñ Component.
‚óá Placeholder instances nested into ‚óá Component instances may be swapped with any other component instances‚Ä¶
More details in this video by @Adam_Ruthendorf-Przewoski.
The next step of its evolution is Layout Blocks by @Mr.Biscuit.
An issue
I have a base ‚ùñ Placeholder component:
‚óá Placeholder instances may be nested into other components (‚ùñ Column here):
image2080√ó384 8.54 KB
What I need is to nest a ‚óá Column instance into another ‚óá Column instance by swapping one of the ‚óá Placeholders.
This is needed to customize Auto Layout spacings and other properties:
image804√ó564 8.43 KB
But when I try to do this I see an error message Failed to set component: cycle detected!:
I totally understand why we‚Äôre not allowed to nest instances into their Main components ‚Äî it will create an endless cycle such as infinite screen share:
image1600√ó808 102 KB
But actually, it is not endless ‚Äî we always will have the last one ‚óá Placeholder instance as a stop point:

My Demo file to better understand what‚Äôs going on.
Possible solutions
There are a couple of solutions that solve this issue but still are not optimal:
Have multiple absolutely identical components to nest one into another.

For the upper-level use a component with more placeholders inside and hide unnecessary ones.
image1092√ó644 12.3 KB

User: I think the only solution for now is to create a ‚ùñ Main Container component with ‚óá slot instances inside. Then you need to create also another component for ‚ùñ Column/Row with variants.

I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for meüí°
User: At the time, I was building custom WordPress themes. 
Within my theme, I'd have a partials folder, full of my silly little components.
And I had my templates folder, full of my silly little templates.
User: Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular, maintainable and organised template files.
Seeing it all come together was a huge a-ha moment for me, but I didn't know why ‚Äì¬†at the time, design systems wasn't a well-known concept.
User: I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass, extending classes, using mixins, and all that fun, CSS goodness.
‚úΩ
Looking back at it now, I realise that what I was really (kind of) doing, was implementing a simplified version of component properties.
User: Code felt natural and intuitive ‚Äì I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly.
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly. But design tooling wasn't anywhere close to what it is now.
User: Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying, pasting and replacing... The process felt outdated and ineffective, and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies.
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code... even the tiniest bit.
User: When I learned about Figma a few years later, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted, and my passion for design exploded.
I'm so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly, and some of the gaps between design/dev are starting to thin out.
User: This was a lot of tweets about nothing, but I woke up feeling so in love with my career.

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior. I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a ‚ÄúSpecial offer‚Äù label placed inside the picture.
In order to reproduce the issue:
Step 1: Create a text field, turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color, just to create a label basically, like ‚ÄúFLASH SALE‚Äù etc‚Ä¶
Step 2: Add a rectangle and fill it with an image.
Step 3: Turn both into an Auto-Layout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside. While doing so, you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it, even when the label layer is above the image.
Despite that, when merging a text and an image into Auto-Layout and only then turning the text to Auto-Layout as well to give if a fill color - this method works perfectly fine, but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned, so there might be a bug here. Or is it?

They have not. I‚Äôm writing this, not 20 minutes after initially downloading and testing it out and it‚Äôs already very clear to me that it simply doesn‚Äôt work. This is only a matter of the interface (which I would say is not super intuitive anyway) - I could have overlooked that, assuming I would get used to it with time - the very basics were not functional. It‚Äôs a battle to do even the simplest actions; scrolling down the page, selecting a template, deleting and creating pages - all the things you rely on regardless of whether the interface is to your liking. Was very willing to give this a good try before I disregarded it, but I don‚Äôt even see how that would be possible without risking all of my uni work/notes. Definitely needs a rethink, which is a shame because, according to the reviews, it works so well on laptop/PC and is obviously very effective. But this app is not conducive to working on an iPad, which effectively renders the point of having a tool that‚Äôs supposed to keep everything in one, easily accessible place moot, because, if you use a tablet (even if it‚Äôs not your main device) you simply can‚Äôt use it on there and so would either not be able to use your iPad anytime you wanted to make a note, or would have to have two separate systems.

User: Figma is an excellent tool that forces a full paradigm shift for us designers. With auto-layout, objects on the page flow freely down the page, just like on the web. It's a 99% complete implementation of flexbox in a design program. Once you've gotten into the mindset shift of rows and columns (everything on a web page is just a nested collection of either rows or columns) you can use auto-layout to position everything on your page, and gone are the days of reflowing the entire comp because the length of the paragraph changed! (Looking at you, Photoshop).
User: The image manipulation tools are lacking. An image is either an object, which is fine, or a background. But there is no ability to set focal point on the backround, or borrow some of the CSS cover/constrain background positions.","Users find Figma helpful for remote collaboration, making their work more effective and efficient.

The only way to programmatically get the real path commands for a PATH type object is to go through the image rest api, retrieve the svg and parse it to get the d attribute.
User: The only way I know how to achieve this image is to outline a stroke, which turns it into a shape, then apply a stroke to that shape.
If that is what you are doing, the information represented by your purple line no longer exists for the node. That loss happens when you outline the stroke and all the information we have to provide is the dashed line stroke geometry.

Which results in a bad experience when the prototype is designed in a higher aspect ratio than the device you‚Äôre testing the prototype with. Main CTAs placed on the bottom of the screen will appear underneath the fold for example.
It would be ideal if you select ‚ÄúFit to screen‚Äù the artboards will actually fit the screen. So if the testing device has a less high aspect ratio than the artboard, space will be added to the sides of the prototype. And if the testing device has a higher aspect ratio than the artboard, space will be added to the top and bottom of the prototype.

User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites

User: Working fully remotely, Miro is my most frequently used software because there is no other tool that lets me collaborate, ideate and present information across screens more easily than Miro.

shout out to @gleb_sexy and @sedatcak ‚≠êÔ∏èü§ùüíØ you've each inspired and facilitated this post in a big way üíñ
User: the editing hat is on ü§† here's a teaser outline of this soon-to-launch blog post:
‚õ∞ Milestone 1: Develop a plan of attack
- Prepare your detective notes.
- Find the highest concentration of layers.
(üëá cont.)
User: ‚õ∞ Milestone 2: Reduce as many layers as possible.
- Remove draft material
- Remove unnecessary hidden layers from regular frames
- Remove all unnecessary hidden layers from main components in your local file
(üëá cont.)
User: ‚õ∞ Milestone 3: Reduce variant count
- Introduce ""exposed nested instances""
- Eliminate ‚Äúfaux-repeater"" properties in favor of using ‚úé content carriers
- Consider divesting from variants altogether üôä
(üëá cont.)
User: ‚õ∞ Milestone 4: Compress images. 
- Leverage the Downsize plugin and ImageOptim
‚õ∞ Milestone 5: Simplify complex vectors.
fin.
User: i put a lot of thought into the order of these steps. my hypothesis is this is the most effective order to gain back Figma file memory as quickly as possible.
again, my newsletter subscribers will be the first to know when I hit publish: <STRICT_LINK>

I‚Äôm having a hard time with something that should be very basic. I have 25 or so screens, the ONLY interaction between them is that the user should be able to click and/or press the arrow key to navigate LINEARLY between them.
Sometimes it works (especially if I go slowly, it works every time). But sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, sometimes it inexplicably jumps through sections (pretty much only happens if I press the arrow keys quickly). It appears that if I click through it goes linearly every time without skipping screens. So the problem is only with the arrow keys (which I can‚Äôt disable so I need to understand the behavior before handing off to my client).
I‚Äôve adjusted all the artboards. The desired order is Row 1 Left to Right, Row 2 Left to Right (as described in the documentation). All rows have the exact same Y coordinate. All columns have the exact same X coordinate.
I‚Äôve spent hours on this already and this is really basic behavior so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so hard, I want it to act like powerpoint in presentation mode.
Any help is appreciated. I can‚Äôt really share the prototype because I‚Äôm on NDA.

 I love the new feature that allows multiple prototypes per page. One issue I‚Äôm having with it, is it assumes I want everything to be a new flow starting point each time I don‚Äôt link something from the first flow starting page. 
It has a very linear mindset. When I work/prototype I tend to work on a section, then link it back and that creates many flow starting points on accident and I have to delete them. 
It‚Äôd be nice if either - it only created the first one, and doesn‚Äôt assume you want many o‚Ä¶

User: FigJam's simplicity and ease of use enables fast mapping and sharing of complex systems and dependencies. I've recently created several sprawling figjam charts that outline marketing programs from beginning to end for our clients. They have been so helpful keeping the team informed at a high level and are a great reference to regularly huddle around. 
 
This is just one kind of use - because of its flexibility you can begin to discover ways to think and present ideas large or small. Create fast design mock-ups, review and provide feedback on designs, create storyboards - the list can go on and on. Easily shareable to anyone with little to no trouble with login attempts or dealing with incompatible file types. 
 
It feels so freeing to break from the clunky confines of a ppt slide with its bad clip art and boring bullet points. Expanding across an endless canvas allows us to combat any confusion or anxiety that tends to show up around building complex marketing campaigns. 
 
Figjam has become one the most valuable tools in my arsenal and is one of the best I've seen after almost 2 decades of working with these types of apps.

Google (while claiming to be user-friendly) had too many tools and GUI's to navigate through which felt overwhelming to me, while still lacking the flexibility I desired. Paper planners I encountered in the store didn't do the job either because they were not formatted exactly how I wanted, and of course a regular old notebook didn't provide the online accessibility I wanted.
Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality. It provided helpful templates I could use to give an overall format for what I wanted to write (checklists, boxes, etc.) which were incredibly customizable. The tool is simple yet powerful, without any unnecessary visual effects or special features you are forced to learn. I love that Notion can be accessed on any device via the website or app, and my plans look the exact same in any format without shifting its orientation or completely up-hauling the website layout.

Turning off ‚Äúsnap to pixel grid‚Äù in a Figma Design file no longer changes snapping behavior when dragging frames around.

When I disable the Chrome Hardware acceleration, I am able to open the Figma without any issue, albeit slower.

Is there anyway to fix it?

User: Hi @Tsasqa_Galih ,
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files?
If this is happening on a specific file, then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits.
Figma is a browser-based app, which means it‚Äôs subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab, including those in our Desktop App. When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit, it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes.
I recommend you to:
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages (for example by splitting a page into multiple pages) will usually help with rendering performance.
Hidden layers: loading and then hiding a large number of layers, especially in components or with images stored in them, can cause a high use of available memory on loading.
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load.
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again.
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows, you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here. Hope it helps!
User: Hi @Celine_Doan
It‚Äôs happening to all files actually.
Which is weird since i can still access all files without issue if i turned the browser hardware acceleration off.
i also tried using my other laptop with the hardware acceleration on to open all the files, and it does not have the same issue.

4558,Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: This app worked fine as a free user, however after becoming a subscribed member, I ran into some annoying and suspicious issues. I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes. Of course, there‚Äôs a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer. I paid $4.99 for the one month subscription, but it won‚Äôt actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe, but I already have. The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay.
My app says I am a subscribed member, so why is it denying me member benefits? I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone, restarting the app, deleting and downloading the app again, logging out and then back in etc. Nothing has worked so far. Not only do I feel robbed, but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription, I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses, but after subscribing, it sends me straight to the subscription choice page. That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it, regardless of if that is actually the case or not. Looking through some of the other lower reviews, I am not the only one who has ran into this problem. Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for.

I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes. Of course, there‚Äôs a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer. I paid $4.99 for the one month subscription, but it won‚Äôt actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe, but I already have. The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay. My app says I am a subscribed member, so why is it denying me member benefits? I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone, restarting the app, deleting and downloading the app again, logging out and then back in etc. Nothing has worked so far. Not only do I feel robbed, but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription, I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses, but after subscribing, it sends me straight to the subscription choice page. That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it, regardless of if that is actually the case or not. Looking through some of the other lower reviews, I am not the only one who has ran into this problem. Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for.

Component A

Nested component C
Component A is made up of two nested components, B and C. Components B and C have properties that are adjusted to provide variants of Component A. They‚Äôre really just for my use.
But if a designer ‚Äúclicks in‚Äù to Component B, for instance, they can see its props, in the right sidebar (which I‚Äôve used primarily to make those Component A variants). I don‚Äôt want them to touch the props for that nested Component B. I‚Äôd like to hide them.

4670,figma,Twitter,"User: Hi all, I am working on a Figma plugin that needs to import style from our team library. Through research I think the way is to first use Figma REST API to get the keys of styles from our library file, and the use figma.importStyleByKeyAsync() to import the style. However, the issue is, this requires me to put my Access token in the plugin, and I don‚Äôt want to. Is there a way for plugin to authenticate when making REST API calls on behalf of the person who uses the plugin?
Or are there any other easier ways to import/access styles from team library file in plugin? Thanks a lot!!!
User: You have several ways:
Users will create their own personal access tokens, which will be inserted into the input field of your plugin.
Users will open the necessary library files, run the plugin there to get the necessary keys, return to another file to continue working.
Hardcode the keys in the plugin.
3.1. Or add these keys to, for example, a JSON file that you or anyone else can keep updating as needed.

User: Hi there,
So, I guess what‚Äôs happening is that the prototype gets stuck between a situation where it‚Äôs opening an overlay because the mouse is on ‚ÄúShop‚Äù, and also closing the overlay because if the mouse has left ‚ÄúShop‚Äù then it should close. This is why it seems to flicker. To fix this, I‚Äôd recommend using interactive components instead of the Overlay feature. An example of what I‚Äôm talking about is in the community file.
Hope this helps!

This helped a lot with the issue but it started another one .

It's pretty intuitive and we use it all the time across many teams to collaborate, brainstorm, plan, whiteboard, etc. We also switched to using FigJam for all team retros in the company.

Recently I‚Äôve switched to an iPad and the functionality has drastically deteriorated in my user experience which is concerning as the iPad is usually touted as a functional productivity device, especially to students for notes. The app often glitches, the toolbar at the bottom for editing font often disappears while working on multiple tabs, sometimes font colours don‚Äôt show up on screen even after multiple tries. There‚Äôs difficulty in moving blocks of text around on the screen for re-ordering sometimes, especially when working with stage manager in the smallest pre-set window.","User experienced issues with Notion on their iPad, such as glitches, disappearing toolbar, and difficulty in moving blocks of text around.

4814,figma,Twitter,"User: If I apply a color style to an object as a fill (or stroke), I can‚Äôt apply any additional fills to that object. I also can‚Äôt change the opacity of that fill when it‚Äôs tied to a style.
Example: I have a button that is a frame with a blue background which is tied to a color style. I want to create a hover effect for that button by adding an additional 10% black fill on top of my blue color. Currently to accomplish this, I have to detach the blue from it‚Äôs color style, then add an additional fill black on top of it and reduce the 2nd fill‚Äôs opacity to 10%. See example screenshots below.
This not only breaks my blue color style, but if I have black as a style in my design system, I can‚Äôt use that color style either.
Has anyone found a workaround for this that I‚Äôm missing?
