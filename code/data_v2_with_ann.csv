Me They ALL run INSIDE my obsdmd  
Be a rebel  
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called Electron
Electron is just a Chrome browser that runs like an app on your desktop
So essentially Obsidian  Snazzy Browser for your notes
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd This allows us  in theory  to browse any website
In practice it works 80 of the time hence I couldnt get it to work with tana_inc or logseq 
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box  with a plugin its easy Lets get to it
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Go to Settings gt Community Plugins Search for Custom Frames
Install it 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry Custom Frames towards end of your list
Find the New Frame button and click it A Frame is such a browser window that we can use to access all of the services
The new entry will appear in the list above the button 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL   or   copy amp paste from Browser
2  open in center to open the service like a tab otherwise its in the sidebar
3  Add Ribbon Icon to display a side icon 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Specify the icon you want to use
Go to  and find an icon you like
Copy paste its name into the icon textfield in previous step 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left
You will have to log in to GoogleAppleEvernote the first time But then it will remember you Just like in a browser
On the top right you find a few buttons to reload the page 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Summary

Notion,Twitter,"After using the AI tool for a while I ran into some issues and also found some toolsplatforms suitable for lazy people
Lets read the conclusion first I recommend the poe_platform platform The supported bots are also quite rich There are no IP requirements and if you have advanced requirements you can directly subscribe on the Poe platform
ChatGPT 
Currently I mainly use Claudes robot on the Poe platform Heres a summary of the advantages Ive discovered
1 Responses will be faster than ChatGPT in Chinese conversations
2 The corpus will be updated in due course I dont know the frequency but at least he can help me sort out the relatively new content Layer2 and Starknet
3 Writing and copywriting skills seem to be stronger than ChatGPT subjective feeling
Lets take a look at other AI tool products in detail
1chatGPT
There are strict restrictions on IP and a global proxyprivacy window must be attached to it before it can be used
There are unstable situations For example I went to WeChat to send a message to him halfway through the conversation and when I came back I had to refresh the page before I could use it
There are occasional interruptions in answering so I need to remind him to continue
In the end he blocked me which is the biggest problem with using it so far 

2Google Bard Google fought back against OpenAIs products Currently I havent been able to experience them due to IP issues so I abandoned them according to the purpose of our lazy people According to feedback from some friends there is still a certain gap between product power and ChatGPT

3Claude
The founder is the former executive vice president of OpenAI This product is very popular in the investment community Its a bit like the capital that didnt invest in Tesla back then placed a heavy bet on Lucid
Its currently completely free to use and supports use of  on Poe and Slack
4Poe
This is an integrated platform made by Quora that supports mainstream AI conversation tools GPT4 and Claude paid subscriptions are also supported
Its the best toolplatform to use so far and you can use it without having to connect to a global agent or open a ladder

5BuddyGPT
This is a GPT robot on Telegram which will be more friendly to heavy TG users Theres a free version but it only supports 10 free messages per month and the subscription costs 599month

6Defalsh
Web3 content aggregation platform with GPT as the information processing engine
There is no need to register and you can use it with authorization through the Metamask wallet Although the introduction says Web3 content aggregation platform it doesnt seem to support onchain data retrieval yet so Im still looking forward to them becoming a Web3 onestop search engine
There seems to be a plan to issue NFTs in the future which is considered a crossborder product

7Notion AI
NotionHQs builtin AI function can help users automatically organize notes correct typos list article highlights translate create tables etc
Suitable for scenarios such as copywriting studying etc
There are free trials and the subscription costs 10month

Users appreciate the product's oversight for projects, its intuitive design, and its ability to integrate other apps and features. Users experience fatigue when zooming in and out, and find it difficult to create visuals and diagrams that are interactive.

Using  as a perfect example created by cnnr_cllhn 
cnnr_cllhn LoseTheVery is a fantastic tool that finds a more concise adjective without using very Example very rich  affluent
The core idea is simple and the UI was chosen to reflect that Its straight to the point just like the Google Search homepage So whats the problem 
cnnr_cllhn  There are 3 main flaws
1 Site feels messy
2 Design lacks consistency
3 Elements feel a little too cramped
Well approach it via negativa style by removing stuff rather than adding
 Lets work on that that using figma
cnnr_cllhn figma 1 Decluttering 
The most important step would be to remove the clutter  the annoying newsletter popup the newsletter section and the newsletter banner Well get back to it later
This has already made a difference The interface looks significantly cleaner 
cnnr_cllhn figma 2 Let the design breathe 
Lets add more whitespace  the more the better This will achieve a better visual separation
Now the very  x  y line instantly grabs our attention 
cnnr_cllhn figma 3 Making buttons prettier 
Buttons look chaotic here randomly spaced different padding etc
Lets increase the font size adjust the padding and replace the word random with a dice icon Well also invert the third button
The buttons now look modern and consistent 
cnnr_cllhn figma 4 Typography 
The typography is a mess 4 diffrent typefaces on one page Lets reduce our typeface choices to just 2 Well leave the sans font but lets choose a different serif font
I would choose a humanist style serif Lets go with Crimson Pro ",Celebrating educators in the Figma for Edu community for Teacher Appreciation Week.

So I guess whats happening is that the prototype gets stuck between a situation where its opening an overlay because the mouse is on Shop and also closing the overlay because if the mouse has left Shop then it should close This is why it seems to flicker To fix this Id recommend using interactive components instead of the Overlay feature An example of what Im talking about is in the community file

figma,G2,"FigJam fills the role of a handful of tools we were previously using across the business We were able to consolidate and say this is the true approved tool across the company Its helped teams align and ensure access across the company via single sign on The access issues we had previously with InVisionFreehand Miro etc are long gone No more requesting to view or edit access
Anyone can get in there and start using it Its pretty intuitive and we use it all the time across many teams to collaborate brainstorm plan whiteboard etc We also switched to using FigJam for all team retros in the company All the templates timer stickers music and more make FigJam fun to use  but not in a way that distracts from the work
I dont dislike the tool at all I will say one pain point we ran into is that there currently isnt a way to use stickies while maintaining anonymity Anyone can go click an icon to toggle the original authors name off and on to see who said it  not ideal for retros BUT our account rep taught us to switch to shapes and we no longer have this problem Would be nice to have a retro setting on a FigJam that would preserve the psychological safety of team members We feel extremely supported by our awesome account rep","Users appreciate FigJam for consolidating multiple tools, improving access across the company, and being intuitive for collaboration and brainstorming.

So Im trying to recreate the wwwpandaexpresscom website and im with the banner part
 
 
 
 
 
My steps are
Create the base structure
Group it
Duplicate it
Adjust the circle and image for second asset
Make it interactive from prototype tab
Create a component set
On the Design Frame i add the component and it went crazy with the line that dragged into the previous asset frame And when i present it none of my clicks works with the banner Ive cross checked the prototyped and Ive selected the on click
Can anyone please correct me on which step did I do wrong
Thankyou
Only link the two variants together within the component Dont also link the component or any of its variants to the instance of that component

Collaboration features are very useful I can easily share link to Miro board with our clients and they dont even have to create Miro account or use Miro app to be able to collaborate 
What I also like about Miro are multiple tools that we can use to create boards like sticky notes diagrams tables shapes and so on

Do spaces persist across profiles within the arc Reading a comment complaining about this stopped me from exploring this browser further
MosesSamPaul arcinternet Hmm profiles are a way to delineate work and personal contexts and so while you can mirror the space setup across profiles you wouldnt expect persistence but Im probably misunderstanding
abhayance arcinternet I dont want to mirror spaces Earlier spaces were persistent across profiles So the whole point of separating personal amp work through profiles was moot I hope spaces act as projects within personal and work contexts

figma,Twitter,"Its known the text line hight its a nightmare However Im struggling with the text box hight even more with Figma Auto Layout
image29661878 323 KB
image38961958 419 KB
When giving padding on Figma autolayout to a button the text position inside the box not the box is not in the centre height In the following example you can see that in one font type there is 2 px space at the bottom and 1 at the top and in the other one 2px at the top and 1 at the bottom
Thats led to 1 the text is not in the centre height 2 the padding is getting extra which then lead to the wrong implementation
Later on CSS the text div wont behave like that and will wrap right around the text
The ideal is that the space padding above and below the text is even and exactly as set in the padding
Is anyone have a solution for this challenge
I am having the exact same issue to the point that I thought I wrote this post  We are trying to define fonts text box behavior and autolayout for a design system so this is a serious problem
There is more space above the ascender than there is below the descender Ideally it should be equal

So I guess whats happening is that the prototype gets stuck between a situation where its opening an overlay because the mouse is on Shop and also closing the overlay because if the mouse has left Shop then it should close This is why it seems to flicker To fix this Id recommend using interactive components instead of the Overlay feature An example of what Im talking about is in the community file
Hope this helps

zoom,Appstore/Playstore,"This app worked fine as a free user however after becoming a subscribed member I ran into some annoying and suspicious issues I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes Of course theres a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer I paid 499 for the one month subscription but it wont actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe but I already have The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay
My app says I am a subscribed member so why is it denying me member benefits I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone restarting the app deleting and downloading the app again logging out and then back in etc Nothing has worked so far Not only do I feel robbed but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses but after subscribing it sends me straight to the subscription choice page That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it regardless of if that is actually the case or not Looking through some of the other lower reviews I am not the only one who has ran into this problem Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for
Summary I paid for premium but the app isnt letting me actually use premium benefits

please fix this Figma its infuriating and breaks the flow of creating prototypes When basically every prototype i create for work requires a list of users and their contact information it becomes a daily problem which destroys efficiency at the very least allow us to paste them without formatting using cmdshiftV or something

Miro is easier to use than an actual whiteboard In particular its easy to attach write move and connect sticky notes and it automatically corrects the connection lines so you can use it more efficiently than an actual whiteboard So you can focus on the discussion Also miro is great for sharing information you create online ensuring that the same image information is conveyed As a comparison to other similar tools its nice to have reaction features icons and formatting that you cant use up
The disadvantage of miro is that the access can be quite slow depending on the board When you first open a board with a lot of information on it you often have to wait a few 10 seconds I hope that this problem will be solved by devising means such as image processing centered on the area where the display priority is being determined Also if you just use it you dont have a chance to see new or useful functions so I think it would be good if you were shown it by a popup This feature may already exist and you may have turned it off yourself but it is true that it does not appear at this time","The user appreciates Miro's versatility, comparing it to a whiteboard that is easy for everyone to use, with features like screenshots repositories, markups, user flows, and progress boards.

figma,G2,"It solves the same problem as other whiteboard app does The fact it comes as part of Figma is a huge plus I might consider using something else if it was a big addon or wasnt part of the main platform There are better apps but the fact that this baked ina s part of Figma is the biggest reason I use it Its great that it allows me to quickly spin up a board and hammer out visual concepts quickly and Id happily use this to create UR artifacts but it has some drawbacks and I wouldnt be able to facilitate some activities
Figjam is a great tool that fulfills a lot of the functionality you get in more advanced whiteboard apps and does more or less a good job of it The ability to deeplink to elements in a board and make sections and postits is fine and works pretty well
There could be more functionality to format and resize postits Itd also be really helpful for the facilitation of workshop activities to be able to show and hide sections this would ideally be on a user or for users or user groups More mechanics like this which allows groups of participants and facilitators to work together would have a positive impact on running workshop activity withing the Figma platform and in FigJam","Users appreciate Figma for its collaborative features, time-saving templates, and ease of creating visually appealing charts and flows.

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,This app worked fine as a free user however after becoming a subscribed member I ran into some annoying and suspicious issues I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes Of course theres a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer I paid 499 for the one month subscription but it wont actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe but I already have The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay My app says I am a subscribed member so why is it denying me member benefits I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone restarting the app deleting and downloading the app again logging out and then back in etc Nothing has worked so far Not only do I feel robbed but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses but after subscribing it sends me straight to the subscription choice page That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it regardless of if that is actually the case or not Looking through some of the other lower reviews I am not the only one who has ran into this problem Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for Summary I paid for premium but the app isnt letting me actually use premium benefits Thank you Frustrated Notion User,"User experienced issues with the app after subscribing, as it would not allow them to use the AI program.

FigJams simplicity and ease of use enables fast mapping and sharing of complex systems and dependencies Ive recently created several sprawling figjam charts that outline marketing programs from beginning to end for our clients They have been so helpful keeping the team informed at a high level and are a great reference to regularly huddle around 
 
This is just one kind of use  because of its flexibility you can begin to discover ways to think and present ideas large or small Create fast design mockups review and provide feedback on designs create storyboards  the list can go on and on Easily shareable to anyone with little to no trouble with login attempts or dealing with incompatible file types 
 
It feels so freeing to break from the clunky confines of a ppt slide with its bad clip art and boring bullet points Expanding across an endless canvas allows us to combat any confusion or anxiety that tends to show up around building complex marketing campaigns

Notion,Twitter,"After using the AI tool for a while I ran into some issues and also found some toolsplatforms suitable for lazy people
Lets read the conclusion first I recommend the poe_platform platform The supported bots are also quite rich There are no IP requirements and if you have advanced requirements you can directly subscribe on the Poe platform
ChatGPT 
Currently I mainly use Claudes robot on the Poe platform Heres a summary of the advantages Ive discovered
1 Responses will be faster than ChatGPT in Chinese conversations
2 The corpus will be updated in due course I dont know the frequency but at least he can help me sort out the relatively new content Layer2 and Starknet
3 Writing and copywriting skills seem to be stronger than ChatGPT subjective feeling
Lets take a look at other AI tool products in detail
1chatGPT
There are strict restrictions on IP and a global proxyprivacy window must be attached to it before it can be used
There are unstable situations For example I went to WeChat to send a message to him halfway through the conversation and when I came back I had to refresh the page before I could use it
There are occasional interruptions in answering so I need to remind him to continue
In the end he blocked me which is the biggest problem with using it so far 

2Google Bard Google fought back against OpenAIs products Currently I havent been able to experience them due to IP issues so I abandoned them according to the purpose of our lazy people According to feedback from some friends there is still a certain gap between product power and ChatGPT

3Claude
The founder is the former executive vice president of OpenAI This product is very popular in the investment community Its a bit like the capital that didnt invest in Tesla back then placed a heavy bet on Lucid
Its currently completely free to use and supports use of  on Poe and Slack
4Poe
This is an integrated platform made by Quora that supports mainstream AI conversation tools GPT4 and Claude paid subscriptions are also supported
Its the best toolplatform to use so far and you can use it without having to connect to a global agent or open a ladder

5BuddyGPT
This is a GPT robot on Telegram which will be more friendly to heavy TG users Theres a free version but it only supports 10 free messages per month and the subscription costs 599month

6Defalsh
Web3 content aggregation platform with GPT as the information processing engine
There is no need to register and you can use it with authorization through the Metamask wallet Although the introduction says Web3 content aggregation platform it doesnt seem to support onchain data retrieval yet so Im still looking forward to them becoming a Web3 onestop search engine
There seems to be a plan to issue NFTs in the future which is considered a crossborder product

7Notion AI
NotionHQs builtin AI function can help users automatically organize notes correct typos list article highlights translate create tables etc
Suitable for scenarios such as copywriting studying etc
There are free trials and the subscription costs 10month

figma,Twitter,"Intro
There is an interesting concept in Figma thats used and was presented by multiple people and has different names Placeholder Slots Dummies Layout Blocks and so on
 Placeholder component is the base one
 Placeholder instances may be nested into another  Component
 Placeholder instances nested into  Component instances may be swapped with any other component instances
More details in this video by Adam_RuthendorfPrzewoski
The next step of its evolution is Layout Blocks by MrBiscuit
An issue
I have a base  Placeholder component
 Placeholder instances may be nested into other components  Column here
image2080384 854 KB
What I need is to nest a  Column instance into another  Column instance by swapping one of the  Placeholders
This is needed to customize Auto Layout spacings and other properties
image804564 843 KB
But when I try to do this I see an error message Failed to set component cycle detected
I totally understand why were not allowed to nest instances into their Main components  it will create an endless cycle such as infinite screen share
image1600808 102 KB
But actually it is not endless  we always will have the last one  Placeholder instance as a stop point
image804932 114 KB
My Demo file to better understand whats going on
Possible solutions
There are a couple of solutions that solve this issue but still are not optimal
Have multiple absolutely identical components to nest one into another
image15681242 223 KB
For the upperlevel use a component with more placeholders inside and hide unnecessary ones
image1092644 123 KB

I think the only solution for now is to create a  Main Container component with  slot instances inside Then you need to create also another component for  ColumnRow with variants With this you can upto 2nd level only Unless yo create a similar column component with different name

The only way I know how to achieve this image is to outline a stroke which turns it into a shape then apply a stroke to that shape
If that is what you are doing the information represented by your purple line no longer exists for the node That loss happens when you outline the stroke and all the information we have to provide is the dashed line stroke geometry

yeah sorry if what i was saying wasnt clear i had to outline the black line to get the dashed line if i didnt outline the black line i would get the code you are looking for youre saying the stroke you have isnt outlined and it is returning an outlined path that should not be happening","The user is saying that they had to outline the black line to get the dashed line, and that the API should not be returning an outlined path if the stroke is not outlined."

Hierarchy and organisation can maintain their association with the tree model but parts of the props can move to each and every pixel in the canvas
Another way to get inspired and think about this is looking at builders people who physically build stuff like roads gardens houses electrical installations etc There are certain patterns emerging like specialized tools big or small hacks when lacking the tools
They carry a bunch of general tools with them have extra tools nearby and focus on speed orand quality When in multiplayer mode each person has a specialized position or supports the main builder with orchestrated moves Their canvas is always messy to the eye
I think a way for figma to speed up Workflows especially as they want to onboard new users globally would be shortcuts for plugins and a clean up and redesign of all the helpful stuff added everywhere the last year Same idea for other design tools"," The user suggests that design tools like Figma could benefit from a shift away from the traditional top bar, sidebar, and canvas model.

One thing that I have found to be a drawback of Miro is its pricing structure While the platform offers a free plan its more advanced features are only available with paid plans which may be expensive for smaller teams or individuals Additionally the platforms extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users and it may take some time to learn how to use everything effectively However Miros support resources including video tutorials and a user community are quite helpful in getting up to speed quickly",The user loves FigJam for its ease of use and prefers it over multiple apps for conceptualizing ideas and storyboards.

Ask questions to bring the community into the conversation

Default autolayout padding based on the big nudge amount in your settings
Allow for tokenization of paddingmargin grids and offer up autolayout parameters based upon those tokens
Allow users to override the padding to 0px at the creation of the autolayout frame by using an alternative key command like ctrlshifta command on mac

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"This app worked fine as a free user however after becoming a subscribed member I ran into some annoying and suspicious issues I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes Of course theres a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer I paid 499 for the one month subscription but it wont actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe but I already have The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay
My app says I am a subscribed member so why is it denying me member benefits I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone restarting the app deleting and downloading the app again logging out and then back in etc Nothing has worked so far Not only do I feel robbed but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses but after subscribing it sends me straight to the subscription choice page That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it regardless of if that is actually the case or not Looking through some of the other lower reviews I am not the only one who has ran into this problem Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for
Summary I paid for premium but the app isnt letting me actually use premium benefits
Thank you Frustrated Notion User","User experienced issues with the app not allowing them to use the AI program after subscribing, despite having paid for it.

This not only breaks my blue color style but if I have black as a style in my design system I cant use that color style either

figma,Twitter,"Hi
Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a Special offer label placed inside the picture
In order to reproduce the issue
Step 1 Create a text field turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color just to create a label basically like FLASH SALE etc
Step 2 Add a rectangle and fill it with an image
Step 3 Turn both into an AutoLayout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside While doing so you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it even when the label layer is above the image
Despite that when merging a text and an image into AutoLayout and only then turning the text to AutoLayout as well to give if a fill color  this method works perfectly fine but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned so there might be a bug here Or is it
Thanks","User encountered an issue in Figma where an image covers a ""Special Offer"" label when both are turned into an Auto-Layout frame, even if the label layer is above the image.

figma,Twitter,"We want to start using versioning in our projects and we are trying to figure out the best way to do it

Our question is if does exist an official way to work with different versions in the same file in order to handle versioning or if there is a better way to do this
Example of what we need
Button v1 branch main
a new feature for Button v1 a new branch from the main branch
Button v2 branch version 2 branch
a new feature for Button v2 a new branch from version 2 branch

After the most recent update of Figma  Pushed a couple of days ago prototypes using Figmas nested component prototyping have been affected This has been cross checked on web links  alternative machines

Is anyone else getting anything similar
Thanks

Describe the problem your experiencing and how your idea helps solve this
When you create an autolayout frame it always defaults to 10px Many design systems call for an 8px grid and in many cases users dont want ANY padding especially where edgetoedge designs are concerned
Ask questions to bring the community into the conversation
What are everyones thoughts about the following solutions
Default autolayout padding based on the big nudge amount in your settings
Allow for tokenization of paddingmargin grids and offer up autolayout parameters based upon those tokens
Allow users to override the padding to 0px at the creation of the autolayout frame by using an alternative key command like ctrlshifta command on mac

Fastest way I found to apply auto layout with 0 paddings 
Select object  optioncmdG  shiftA
Actually even faster Select object  cmdG  shiftA ","Users discuss the issue of autolayout frames in Figma defaulting to 10px padding, which is not suitable for all design systems.

figma,Twitter,"Hi I have an using when using the Figma
When I disable the Chrome Hardware acceleration I am able to open the Figma without any issue albeit slower
But when I enable the chrome hardware acceleration setting everytime I open Figma my browser will flicker once and says that my browser did not support WEBGL
Is there anyway to fix it
I need to enable the hardware acceleration for other chrome features But then I wont be able to use Figma if I do so
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files
If this is happening on a specific file then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits
Figma is a browserbased app which means its subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab including those in our Desktop App When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes
I recommend you to
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages for example by splitting a page into multiple pages will usually help with rendering performance
Hidden layers loading and then hiding a large number of layers especially in components or with images stored in them can cause a high use of available memory on loading
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here Hope it helps
Hi Celine_Doan
Its happening to all files actually
Which is weird since i can still access all files without issue if i turned the browser hardware acceleration off
i also tried using my other laptop with the hardware acceleration on to open all the files and it does not have the same issue
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Thank you for the details
Can you also ensure WebGL is enabled in Google Chrome The steps to do this are in this article 
If it is still doesnt fix your issue please reach out to the team by filling this form with all detail you recall WEBGL issue happening to all files affecting browser andor desktop etc here
Our technical team can investigate further Thank you
thanks Celine i followed the steps needed on the article and it still doesnt work
but ill fill the form you provided
Cheers"," User experiences browser flickering and WebGL issues when using Figma with Chrome hardware acceleration enabled, affecting all files.

figma,Twitter,"Ive been a designer for a little over 13 years Early in my design career I started feeling like I wanted a more technical role and switched to frontend development
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for me
At the time I was building custom WordPress themes 
Within my theme Id have a partials folder full of my silly little components
And I had my templates folder full of my silly little templates
Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular maintainable and organised template files
Seeing it all come together was a huge aha moment for me but I didnt know why  at the time design systems wasnt a wellknown concept
I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass extending classes using mixins and all that fun CSS goodness

Looking back at it now I realise that what I was really kind of doing was implementing a simplified version of component properties
Code felt natural and intuitive  I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly But design tooling wasnt anywhere close to what it is now
Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying pasting and replacing The process felt outdated and ineffective and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code even the tiniest bit
When I learned about Figma a few years later it felt like a huge weight had been lifted and my passion for design exploded
Im so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly and some of the gaps between designdev are starting to thin out
This was a lot of tweets about nothing but I woke up feeling so in love with my career 
And just generally grateful that I get to sit around all day working on design systems architecting components crafting design patterns and collaborating with developers 
I dont think Id be so passionate about my career if figma didnt come around when it did  Its setting the standard of things to come and were only at the beginning ","The user has published a new version of the #pagger in the @figma community, which now allows users to assign tags, prevents the state of the pages from being shared between accounts, and allows users to test it as long as they want (not in the same file)."

I started using Miro when COVID hit and we started working from home We originally started using it as a simple whiteboard replacement As we became more familiar with the tool we saw its power as more than a whiteboard replacement
Miro is very comprehensive The comprehensiveness leads to frequent software updates It becomes a little irritating that whenever you open the software it prompts you to restart to download the updates","Users appreciate Miro's collaborative capabilities and initially used it as a whiteboard replacement during remote work. However, they find the frequent software updates irritating and disruptive to their workflow."
figma,G2,"I can analyse data in visual form really quickly on Miro  it really helps connect the dots when you can see all of the information in one space it is also really helpful as a collaborative tool  i no longer have to be the single scribe everyone can contribute actively during brainstorming and it really helps with getting open feedback from stakeholders which is not often easy to do verbally i dont think i could be without miro especially in a remote working environment
Working fully remotely Miro is my most frequently used software because there is no other tool that lets me collaborate ideate and present information across screens more easily than Miro I cant say that i even miss physical brainstorming boards because i no longer have to transfer handwritten notes to a digital format  it saves so much time and nothing goes missing its really easy to track information and review past discussions because everything is captured digitally all of the tools and templates are very handy i dont have to think to much about how to structure information  its plug and play and theres so much you can do the interface is very intuitive
Miro on ipad pro could be improved to leverage the capabilities of tablets i use miro exclusively on my computer and hardly ever on the ipad because it is very buggy and takes too long to do what i would normally do on a computer writing is fine but its not enough for me to also use miro on my tablet  its a shame but i guess Freeform is a good simple and free alternative it would also be great if Miro could be used in offline mode with an option to sync once online","The user finds Miro extremely helpful for collaborating and presenting information across screens, especially in a remote working environment.

figma,Twitter," How to turn an almost perfect UIUX to perfect
Using  as a perfect example created by cnnr_cllhn 
cnnr_cllhn LoseTheVery is a fantastic tool that finds a more concise adjective without using very Example very rich  affluent
The core idea is simple and the UI was chosen to reflect that Its straight to the point just like the Google Search homepage So whats the problem 
cnnr_cllhn  There are 3 main flaws
1 Site feels messy
2 Design lacks consistency
3 Elements feel a little too cramped
Well approach it via negativa style by removing stuff rather than adding
 Lets work on that that using figma
cnnr_cllhn figma 1 Decluttering 
The most important step would be to remove the clutter  the annoying newsletter popup the newsletter section and the newsletter banner Well get back to it later
This has already made a difference The interface looks significantly cleaner ","A user discussed how to improve the UI/UX of a website called LoseTheVery, which helps find concise adjectives.

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"Ill start by saying that I absolutely love the concept of Notion I have created several pages to hold databases and logs for my books movies courses home renovation projects exercises plans etc
The only issue is It does not work on my iPad The interface seems to be the same as on my MacBook but I run into several issues when trying to work with the layouts I also have a MAJOR issue with my Magic Keyboard Which at this point doesnt seem to work at all I go open a new page or template click on the space to begin typing and nothing happens Not sure if I have to fix a setting or something but this makes the app pretty unusable for my preferred method of using it","User loves the concept of Notion but has issues with the app on their iPad, as it doesn't work properly with the layouts and the Magic Keyboard doesn't work.

figma,G2,"I have created a Creative Hack workshop template which I use to help teams and clients come up with ideas 
Ill also use Miro for other team tasks in which multiple people need to make inputs 
Its helpful for capturing a large amount of information in a little amount time and ultimately making sense of those inputs
I describe Miro as an Adobe Illustrator Group Chat I love the drag and drop flexibility of it and ease of use which allows me to capture ideas and feedback in real time Even when Im working with large groups of people the tool enables me to synthesize conversations and sharebacks in a way that captures the essence of a meeting
I have a few small feedback options for Miro 
 
1 For some reason I am forced to put a password on a board when I make it publically editable It didnt used to be like this and I find it annoying that I have to do that every time I end up just saying miroboard for everything 
 
2 When I invite outside of my org participants to join a board Via the UX they often think they have to sign up to view the board which leads to time lost in the session correcting them and getting them to the board as a guest quickly 
 
3 Not sure if this is still the case but I wish I could give people outside of my team permission to lock objects I work across teams so sometimes Im unable to lock assets on colleagues boards and vice versa","Users appreciate Miro for its ease of use, real-time collaboration, and ability to capture ideas effectively. However, they face issues with forced password protection on public boards, confusing UX for inviting external participants, and limited permission options for locking objects across teams."

It would be nice to see different help articles and tools based on user sophistication and comfort level with the product","User appreciates the infinite canvas, voting, stickers, and rich diagramming tools in Figma, as well as multiple app integration, allowing them to use it as their primary productivity tool. They also appreciate the lack of a private space in the enterprise version, which only allows them to keep documents for themselves."
zoom,Appstore/Playstore,I find it difficult and unintuitive to use it on the iPad I cant do simple things like changing the background color of a callout it just lets me select text or suddenly there are times when the page freezes and it doesnt react I dont know if it will be a problem because I have the Apple Pencil nearby or what The PC app works much better for me,Nothing
figma,G2,"Miro is helping us to work remotely by helping us to collaborate more efficiently It is easier to gather feedback in user research using Miro We are using Miro to conduct our Sprint Retrospectives which provides many inbuilt templates After any workshop or interview the outputs are summarised in Miro and it is reviewed within team virtually without having to schedule any meeting
It helps teams to collaborate efficiently and exchange ideas It acts as a virtual whiteboard and allows teams in different parts of the globe to interact and exchange ideas
Lots of features and difficult to lock frames",Users appreciate Figma's ease of use and aesthetics but face challenges in distributing information effectively when working remotely with cross-functional teams.

FigJam makes creating diagrams and flowcharts very easy In my job I often need visual aids to explain technical systems and I need to create those aids more or less on the fly FigJam has been a lifesaver in that regard
My only complaints about FigJam are very small the biggest of which is that I wish it were simpler to create multiple wire attachment points on one side of a shape using a snaptogrid alignment There are times when I need 4 discrete wires running into one side of a shape and I dont necessarily want them all going to the central point","Users appreciate Figma for its ease of use and advanced features, which facilitate collaboration on process changes, improvements, and prioritization planning.
