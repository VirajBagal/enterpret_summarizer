It'd also be really helpful, for the facilitation of workshop activities, to be able to show and hide sections. this would ideally be on a user or for users or user groups.

User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi, I have an using when using the Figma.
When I disable the Chrome Hardware acceleration, I am able to open the Figma without any issue, albeit slower.
But when I enable the chrome hardware acceleration setting, everytime I open Figma, my browser will flicker once, and says that my browser did not support WEBGL.
Is there anyway to fix it?
I need to enable the hardware acceleration for other chrome features. But then I won‚Äôt be able to use Figma if I do so.
User: Hi @Tsasqa_Galih ,
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files?
If this is happening on a specific file, then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits.
Figma is a browser-based app, which means it‚Äôs subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab, including those in our Desktop App. When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit, it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes.
I recommend you to:
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages (for example by splitting a page into multiple pages) will usually help with rendering performance.
Hidden layers: loading and then hiding a large number of layers, especially in components or with images stored in them, can cause a high use of available memory on loading.
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load.
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again.
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows, you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here. Hope it helps!
User: Hi @Celine_Doan
It‚Äôs happening to all files actually.
Which is weird since i can still access all files without issue if i turned the browser hardware acceleration off.
i also tried using my other laptop with the hardware acceleration on to open all the files, and it does not have the same issue.

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi all, I am working on a Figma plugin that needs to import style from our team library. Through research I think the way is to first use Figma REST API to get the keys of styles from our library file, and the use figma.importStyleByKeyAsync() to import the style. However, the issue is, this requires me to put my Access token in the plugin, and I don‚Äôt want to. Is there a way for plugin to authenticate when making REST API calls on behalf of the person who uses the plugin?
Or are there any other easier ways to import/access styles from team library file in plugin? Thanks a lot!!!
User: You have several ways:
Users will create their own personal access tokens, which will be inserted into the input field of your plugin.
Users will open the necessary library files, run the plugin there to get the necessary keys, return to another file to continue working.
Hardcode the keys in the plugin.
3.1. Or add these keys to, for example, a JSON file that you or anyone else can keep updating as needed.

Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)
<STRICT_LINK>
User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space?
E.g. my Slack always open links in my work space/profile?
I'm logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces.
User: @JiriJerabek @browsercompany Great question. Not right now, but this feature for link routing by Space is coming in a couple weeks üëÄ

If you get paid to do the service, please make it a little straight...
No matter how many times I delete and reinstall the app, the document doesn't open. (Infinite loading) It takes 3 to 4 times to open properly, and even then, if you turn off the app, it loads infinitely again...

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: I'm not a big planner to begin with, probably due to my lack of enjoyment for more mainstream planners like Google calendar and traditional paper planners. Google (while claiming to be user-friendly) had too many tools and GUI's to navigate through which felt overwhelming to me, while still lacking the flexibility I desired. Paper planners I encountered in the store didn't do the job either because they were not formatted exactly how I wanted, and of course a regular old notebook didn't provide the online accessibility I wanted.
Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality. It provided helpful templates I could use to give an overall format for what I wanted to write (checklists, boxes, etc.) which were incredibly customizable. The tool is simple yet powerful, without any unnecessary visual effects or special features you are forced to learn. I love that Notion can be accessed on any device via the website or app, and my plans look the exact same in any format without shifting its orientation or completely up-hauling the website layout. I would recommend this to anyone.","User finds Notion helpful for organizing their daily tasks and planning their week, as it provides templates and customizable tools for organizing their tasks.

I have used it in situations as the sole driver while sharing my screen with the team to get a quick diagram or mind map put together, and I have also used it collaboratively with my team as a digital whiteboard. You can bring people into FigJam and have them collaborating within minutes whether they are familiar with the tech or not.
User: Being able to join with several colleagues, throw together a quick brainstorm and work quickly has been great! I have used FigJam professionally to lay out calendar schedules, run retros, and run client workshops.

Sometimes it works (especially if I go slowly, it works every time). But sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, sometimes it inexplicably jumps through sections (pretty much only happens if I press the arrow keys quickly). It appears that if I click through it goes linearly every time without skipping screens. So the problem is only with the arrow keys (which I can‚Äôt disable so I need to understand the behavior before handing off to my client).
I‚Äôve adjusted all the artboards. The desired order is Row 1 Left to Right, Row 2 Left to Right (as described in the documentation). All rows have the exact same Y coordinate. All columns have the exact same X coordinate.
I‚Äôve spent hours on this already and this is really basic behavior so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so hard, I want it to act like powerpoint in presentation mode.
Any help is appreciated. I can‚Äôt really share the prototype because I‚Äôm on NDA.
User: Or up vote the solution here‚Ä¶
 
 
 
 Remove auto creating flow starting points Share an idea
 
 
 I love the new feature that allows multiple prototypes per page. One issue I‚Äôm having with it, is it assumes I want everything to be a new flow starting point each time I don‚Äôt link something from the first flow starting page. 
It has a very linear mindset. When I work/prototype I tend to work on a section, then link it back and that creates many flow starting points on accident and I have to delete them. 
It‚Äôd be nice if either - it only created the first one, and doesn‚Äôt assume you want many o‚Ä¶

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi,
Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior. I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a ‚ÄúSpecial offer‚Äù label placed inside the picture.
In order to reproduce the issue:
Step 1: Create a text field, turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color, just to create a label basically, like ‚ÄúFLASH SALE‚Äù etc‚Ä¶
Step 2: Add a rectangle and fill it with an image.
Step 3: Turn both into an Auto-Layout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside. While doing so, you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it, even when the label layer is above the image.
Despite that, when merging a text and an image into Auto-Layout and only then turning the text to Auto-Layout as well to give if a fill color - this method works perfectly fine, but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned, so there might be a bug here. Or is it?

But when I enable the chrome hardware acceleration setting, everytime I open Figma, my browser will flicker once, and says that my browser did not support WEBGL.
Is there anyway to fix it?
I need to enable the hardware acceleration for other chrome features. But then I won‚Äôt be able to use Figma if I do so.
User: Hi @Tsasqa_Galih ,
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files?
If this is happening on a specific file, then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits.
Figma is a browser-based app, which means it‚Äôs subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab, including those in our Desktop App. When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit, it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes.
I recommend you to:
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages (for example by splitting a page into multiple pages) will usually help with rendering performance.
Hidden layers: loading and then hiding a large number of layers, especially in components or with images stored in them, can cause a high use of available memory on loading.
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load.
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again.
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows, you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here. Hope it helps!
User: Hi @Celine_Doan
It‚Äôs happening to all files actually.
Which is weird since i can still access all files without issue if i turned the browser hardware acceleration off.
i also tried using my other laptop with the hardware acceleration on to open all the files, and it does not have the same issue.
User: Hi @Tsasqa_Galih ,
Thank you for the details!
Can you also ensure WebGL is enabled in Google Chrome? The steps to do this are in this article: <STRICT_LINK>
If it is still doesn‚Äôt fix your issue, please reach out to the team by filling this form with all detail you recall (WEBGL issue, happening to all files, affecting browser and/or desktop etc): here

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: I'm not a big planner to begin with, probably due to my lack of enjoyment for more mainstream planners like Google calendar and traditional paper planners. Google (while claiming to be user-friendly) had too many tools and GUI's to navigate through which felt overwhelming to me, while still lacking the flexibility I desired. Paper planners I encountered in the store didn't do the job either because they were not formatted exactly how I wanted, and of course a regular old notebook didn't provide the online accessibility I wanted.
Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality. It provided helpful templates I could use to give an overall format for what I wanted to write (checklists, boxes, etc.) which were incredibly customizable. The tool is simple yet powerful, without any unnecessary visual effects or special features you are forced to learn. I love that Notion can be accessed on any device via the website or app, and my plans look the exact same in any format without shifting its orientation or completely up-hauling the website layout.

figma,Twitter,"User: I‚Äôve been a designer for a little over 13 years. Early in my design career, I started feeling like I wanted a more ‚Äòtechnical role‚Äô and switched to front-end development.
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for meüí°
User: At the time, I was building custom WordPress themes. 
Within my theme, I'd have a partials folder, full of my silly little components.
And I had my templates folder, full of my silly little templates.
User: Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular, maintainable and organised template files.
Seeing it all come together was a huge a-ha moment for me, but I didn't know why ‚Äì¬†at the time, design systems wasn't a well-known concept.
User: I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass, extending classes, using mixins, and all that fun, CSS goodness.
‚úΩ
Looking back at it now, I realise that what I was really (kind of) doing, was implementing a simplified version of component properties.
User: Code felt natural and intuitive ‚Äì I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly.
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly. But design tooling wasn't anywhere close to what it is now.
User: Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying, pasting and replacing... The process felt outdated and ineffective, and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies.
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code... even the tiniest bit.
User: When I learned about Figma a few years later, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted, and my passion for design exploded.
I'm so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly, and some of the gaps between design/dev are starting to thin out.
User: This was a lot of tweets about nothing, but I woke up feeling so in love with my career.

Main CTAs placed on the bottom of the screen will appear underneath the fold for example.
It would be ideal if you select ‚ÄúFit to screen‚Äù the artboards will actually fit the screen. So if the testing device has a less high aspect ratio than the artboard, space will be added to the sides of the prototype.

figma,Twitter,"User: I‚Äôve been a designer for a little over 13 years. Early in my design career, I started feeling like I wanted a more ‚Äòtechnical role‚Äô and switched to front-end development.
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for meüí°
User: At the time, I was building custom WordPress themes. 
Within my theme, I'd have a partials folder, full of my silly little components.
And I had my templates folder, full of my silly little templates.
User: Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular, maintainable and organised template files.
Seeing it all come together was a huge a-ha moment for me, but I didn't know why ‚Äì¬†at the time, design systems wasn't a well-known concept.
User: I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass, extending classes, using mixins, and all that fun, CSS goodness.
‚úΩ
Looking back at it now, I realise that what I was really (kind of) doing, was implementing a simplified version of component properties.
User: Code felt natural and intuitive ‚Äì I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly.
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly. But design tooling wasn't anywhere close to what it is now.
User: Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying, pasting and replacing... The process felt outdated and ineffective, and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies.
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code... even the tiniest bit.
User: When I learned about Figma a few years later, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted, and my passion for design exploded.
I'm so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly, and some of the gaps between design/dev are starting to thin out.

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior. I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a ‚ÄúSpecial offer‚Äù label placed inside the picture.
In order to reproduce the issue:
Step 1: Create a text field, turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color, just to create a label basically, like ‚ÄúFLASH SALE‚Äù etc‚Ä¶
Step 2: Add a rectangle and fill it with an image.
Step 3: Turn both into an Auto-Layout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside. While doing so, you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it, even when the label layer is above the image.
Despite that, when merging a text and an image into Auto-Layout and only then turning the text to Auto-Layout as well to give if a fill color - this method works perfectly fine, but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned, so there might be a bug here. Or is it?

One improvement that would be great: on iOS when I share a youtube video to a notion database via share sheet, the URL is the title.

Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay

User: I love that you can collaborate with everyone at the same time truly. Building out the space for the collaboration is easy to do, allowing it to be prepared ahead of time. You can move between presentation mode and working mode quickly. Miro has made my workshops much more interactive. 
 
I love the built-in grouping and voting functionality. These provide a level of quick feedback you often to do receive in collaboration tools.
User: The number 1 item is don't count on everyone having received your invite to the board when you share. If you need someone in a meeting, you must have them validate prior that they have access.

Notion,Twitter,"User: **Arc browser continuous review**
Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)
<STRICT_LINK>
User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space?
E.g. my Slack always open links in my work space/profile?
I'm logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces.
User: @JiriJerabek @browsercompany Great question. Not right now, but this feature for link routing by Space is coming in a couple weeks üëÄ
Can't wait to hear what you think!","
 The user is enjoying the new features in Arc, including the split view, sidebar, and the ability to pin folders. They are also impressed with the iOS app, which allows them to open links in specific spaces. However, they are concerned about the lack of a mobile app and the lack of a way to tell apps to open links in specific spaces.",0.42515191435813904

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: Notion is an absolutely fantastic app for projects, notes, sorting, and many many more due to its versatility and freedom. As a single person, notion is completely free with next to no restrictions. Teams will require payment, but it has a free trial to see how you like it, and I consider it fantastic for groups. However, that being said, mobile notion is severely lacking in certain features that the desktop version has. Basic features like renaming your workspace can only be done on desktop. There are also some bugs with the ui, like the back arrow sometimes just straight up sending me out of the current workspace, and the toolbar disappearing and requiring me to restart the app.
These don‚Äôt ruin the app by any means, as notion is still an amazing app and is still amazing in mobile, but I would consider mobile notion a great ADDITION to your desktop notion. Use desktop as your main form of using notion when creating, and use mobile when you‚Äôre away from the desktop or need to check something. Mobile as your only form of using notion isn‚Äôt terrible, but it‚Äôs definitely inferior.
Notion overall is an amazing app with amazing developers, who deserve lots of love and support. They also gave major generosity with the app, of which many other services would‚Äôve charged the individual a large amount of money to use what notion gives for free, which again is pretty much everything except very minor things like upload file size limits.","User praises Notion for its versatility and freedom, but notes that mobile version lacks certain features and has bugs.

Notion,Twitter,"User: **Arc browser continuous review**
Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)

I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.

I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!

What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!

User: It is extremely intuitive to get started as a new user. It has become an essential tool for remote collaboration on my team of primarily visual thinkers.

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: Notion would be amazing if if it was easy to do easy things. There is a lot of functionality that would make your life a lot easier. What takes away from all of this potential is a buggy and nagging experience trying to input information.

User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)

User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space?

User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!

Notion,Twitter,"User: **Arc browser continuous review**
Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)
<STRICT_LINK>
User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space?

There are a few flaws though: there is no offline mode, the AI features that I don‚Äòt use cannot be deactivated, is is not as fast as a native app like apple notes/simplenote/etc., there is no real pen-support for drawing and sketching, the app logs me out frequently and that feeling of ‚Äûhaving too many eggs in one basket‚Äú
One improvement that would be great: on iOS when I share a youtube video to a notion database via share sheet, the URL is the title.

User: Its really a heartbreaker that exporting the slices to pdf is not available in Figma. Sketch has it and it was working really great for us.
Some of our multinational stakeholders, whom we cannot insist to install or start an account for Figma or anything else, as they rely on pdf documents for design review or sharing with internal team.

figma,G2,"User: This is my #1 choice of tool when collaborating with clients. My team uses Miro to document a strategy or wireframe and collect client feedback in real-time, it helps ensure the client that we are listening to their wants and needs. Instead of using a static PPT where we are just jotting down the notes, clients can see the work in action. In addition, we use the Miro board to document processes and attach key artifacts and URLS. This process documentation is exhaustive but Miro allows users to zoom in and out from a micro/macro view to learn about the process which is great for leadership to see and great for onboarding. It especially works for a global remote company where we can all jump in to review no matter the time zone. If you are in the same time zone, it works great to get everyone in the room and use as a collaboration tool. For example, I'm located in California and my client is located in the UK. We use miro to make updates on our timezone and get very detailed in specific areas of question. It allows for transparency, review, and collaboration.
User: In general, I like the whiteboarding and mapping capabilities that allow for deep thought, process documentation, and pure collaboration with teams. It allows me to jot my rough thoughts on paper where I then can find patterns and create a more solid process. Miro is the perfect think tank environment that you use from start (ideation) to a finish (a solid concept). It's also great for inviting colleagues for feedback or collaboration. Anyone can use it with a free license.
User: Miroboards have a size capacity where if you add too many screenshots, it starts to slow down. It can also get extremely messy and often confusing for a new user coming in and unsure where to start. Sometimes if you start your miroboard too big, the details of things like adding arrow connectors can be really tiny. Causing me to selecting all and sizing down my space so you can see these details. I sometimes run into issues with font formatting, if I copied and pasted a highlighted text in bold and then I drag in the text widget, it will copy what I've used when that is not my intention.

I know that Figma objects don‚Äôt care about the scale in the relativeTransform and have to be resized using resize(). How do I adjust the transform to ‚Äúremove‚Äù the scale but keep the correct rotation and especially skew?
In this picture I first scale then rotate, the points are transformed correctly, the rectangle and star are not. 
Here first I rotate then scale:
Here is skew. If that‚Äôs all I do, it works:

I‚Äôm having a hard time with something that should be very basic. I have 25 or so screens, the ONLY interaction between them is that the user should be able to click and/or press the arrow key to navigate LINEARLY between them.
Sometimes it works (especially if I go slowly, it works every time). But sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, sometimes it inexplicably jumps through sections (pretty much only happens if I press the arrow keys quickly). It appears that if I click through it goes linearly every time without skipping screens. So the problem is only with the arrow keys (which I can‚Äôt disable so I need to understand the behavior before handing off to my client).
I‚Äôve adjusted all the artboards. The desired order is Row 1 Left to Right, Row 2 Left to Right (as described in the documentation). All rows have the exact same Y coordinate. All columns have the exact same X coordinate.
I‚Äôve spent hours on this already and this is really basic behavior so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so hard, I want it to act like powerpoint in presentation mode.
Any help is appreciated. I can‚Äôt really share the prototype because I‚Äôm on NDA.

 Remove auto creating flow starting points Share an idea
 
 
 I love the new feature that allows multiple prototypes per page. One issue I‚Äôm having with it, is it assumes I want everything to be a new flow starting point each time I don‚Äôt link something from the first flow starting page. 
It has a very linear mindset. When I work/prototype I tend to work on a section, then link it back and that creates many flow starting points on accident and I have to delete them. 
It‚Äôd be nice if either - it only created the first one, and doesn‚Äôt assume you want many o‚Ä¶

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi,
Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior. I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a ‚ÄúSpecial offer‚Äù label placed inside the picture.
In order to reproduce the issue:
Step 1: Create a text field, turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color, just to create a label basically, like ‚ÄúFLASH SALE‚Äù etc‚Ä¶
Step 2: Add a rectangle and fill it with an image.
Step 3: Turn both into an Auto-Layout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside. While doing so, you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it, even when the label layer is above the image.
Despite that, when merging a text and an image into Auto-Layout and only then turning the text to Auto-Layout as well to give if a fill color - this method works perfectly fine, but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned, so there might be a bug here. Or is it?
Thanks.",User faced an issue with a button not working after making changes in the preview. They provided a link to the issue and requested assistance.,0.11333062499761581
figma,Twitter,"User: I use scale tool (K key) to scale design for mobile version.
When I literally click the instance of the nested scaled component it discards the scale and reverts the instance to the original size.
CMD + Z doesn‚Äôt change it back to the scaled version and the layout stays ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. So I have to use version history to revert everything back or as a work around I change size of the original component and it magically re-render the scaled instance and reverts it back until the next interaction.
How to stop Figma from this behavior?
","Users discuss the issue of autolayout frames in Figma defaulting to 10px padding, which is not suitable for all design systems. They suggest solutions like basing default padding on the big nudge amount in settings, allowing tokenization of padding/margin grids, and using alternative key commands for 0px padding.

figma,G2,"User: Helps to visually explain complex systems in a simple way. Provides value to our consultancy.
User: FigJam's simplicity and ease of use enables fast mapping and sharing of complex systems and dependencies. I've recently created several sprawling figjam charts that outline marketing programs from beginning to end for our clients. They have been so helpful keeping the team informed at a high level and are a great reference to regularly huddle around. 
 
This is just one kind of use - because of its flexibility you can begin to discover ways to think and present ideas large or small. Create fast design mock-ups, review and provide feedback on designs, create storyboards - the list can go on and on. Easily shareable to anyone with little to no trouble with login attempts or dealing with incompatible file types. 
 
It feels so freeing to break from the clunky confines of a ppt slide with its bad clip art and boring bullet points. Expanding across an endless canvas allows us to combat any confusion or anxiety that tends to show up around building complex marketing campaigns. 
 
Figjam has become one the most valuable tools in my arsenal and is one of the best I've seen after almost 2 decades of working with these types of apps.

But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc

What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: I'm not a big planner to begin with, probably due to my lack of enjoyment for more mainstream planners like Google calendar and traditional paper planners.

Paper planners I encountered in the store didn't do the job either because they were not formatted exactly how I wanted, and of course a regular old notebook didn't provide the online accessibility I wanted.
Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality. It provided helpful templates I could use to give an overall format for what I wanted to write (checklists, boxes, etc.) which were incredibly customizable.

User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.

(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""

It provides a centralized platform for product managers to collaborate with their team members and stakeholders, regardless of their location. Miro's digital whiteboard allows product managers to brainstorm and ideate with their team, visually organize their ideas, and prioritize their tasks. It also helps product managers manage their projects effectively, create and manage product roadmaps, user story maps, and agile and Scrum methodologies.
User: Miro is an excellent tool for collaborating and brainstorming with teams remotely. Its vast canvas space, extensive library of pre-made templates, and user-friendly interface make it easy to create and share ideas visually. I particularly like its real-time collaboration feature which allows team members to work together seamlessly, regardless of their location. Overall, Miro is a robust and flexible tool that can be used for various purposes, from project management to creative brainstorming sessions.

User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior. I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a ‚ÄúSpecial offer‚Äù label placed inside the picture.
In order to reproduce the issue:
Step 1: Create a text field, turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color, just to create a label basically, like ‚ÄúFLASH SALE‚Äù etc‚Ä¶
Step 2: Add a rectangle and fill it with an image.
Step 3: Turn both into an Auto-Layout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside. While doing so, you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it, even when the label layer is above the image.
Despite that, when merging a text and an image into Auto-Layout and only then turning the text to Auto-Layout as well to give if a fill color - this method works perfectly fine, but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned, so there might be a bug here. Or is it?

I‚Äôm having a hard time with something that should be very basic. I have 25 or so screens, the ONLY interaction between them is that the user should be able to click and/or press the arrow key to navigate LINEARLY between them.
Sometimes it works (especially if I go slowly, it works every time). But sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, sometimes it inexplicably jumps through sections (pretty much only happens if I press the arrow keys quickly). It appears that if I click through it goes linearly every time without skipping screens. So the problem is only with the arrow keys (which I can‚Äôt disable so I need to understand the behavior before handing off to my client).
I‚Äôve adjusted all the artboards. The desired order is Row 1 Left to Right, Row 2 Left to Right (as described in the documentation). All rows have the exact same Y coordinate. All columns have the exact same X coordinate.
I‚Äôve spent hours on this already and this is really basic behavior so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so hard, I want it to act like powerpoint in presentation mode.
Any help is appreciated. I can‚Äôt really share the prototype because I‚Äôm on NDA.

 I love the new feature that allows multiple prototypes per page. One issue I‚Äôm having with it, is it assumes I want everything to be a new flow starting point each time I don‚Äôt link something from the first flow starting page. 
It has a very linear mindset. When I work/prototype I tend to work on a section, then link it back and that creates many flow starting points on accident and I have to delete them. 
It‚Äôd be nice if either - it only created the first one, and doesn‚Äôt assume you want many o‚Ä¶

User: Hi there,
So, I guess what‚Äôs happening is that the prototype gets stuck between a situation where it‚Äôs opening an overlay because the mouse is on ‚ÄúShop‚Äù, and also closing the overlay because if the mouse has left ‚ÄúShop‚Äù then it should close. This is why it seems to flicker. To fix this, I‚Äôd recommend using interactive components instead of the Overlay feature. An example of what I‚Äôm talking about is in the community file.
Hope this helps!

This helped a lot with the issue but it started another one .

Paper planners I encountered in the store didn't do the job either because they were not formatted exactly how I wanted, and of course a regular old notebook didn't provide the online accessibility I wanted.
Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality. It provided helpful templates I could use to give an overall format for what I wanted to write (checklists, boxes, etc.) which were incredibly customizable. The tool is simple yet powerful, without any unnecessary visual effects or special features you are forced to learn. I love that Notion can be accessed on any device via the website or app, and my plans look the exact same in any format without shifting its orientation or completely up-hauling the website layout.

User: The only way I know how to achieve this image is to outline a stroke, which turns it into a shape, then apply a stroke to that shape.
If that is what you are doing, the information represented by your purple line no longer exists for the node. That loss happens when you outline the stroke and all the information we have to provide is the dashed line stroke geometry.

Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay

Paper planners I encountered in the store didn't do the job either because they were not formatted exactly how I wanted, and of course a regular old notebook didn't provide the online accessibility I wanted.
Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality. It provided helpful templates I could use to give an overall format for what I wanted to write (checklists, boxes, etc.) which were incredibly customizable. The tool is simple yet powerful, without any unnecessary visual effects or special features you are forced to learn.

Create a bullet point, and click the hamburger menu, ‚Äúchange to..‚Äù, ‚Äúto do list‚Äù, to do list doesn‚Äôt populate.

figma,G2,"User: How might we collaborate efficiently in a hybrid work environment? 
 
Workshopping within miro means people can participate in workshops remotely, regardless of where they are in the planet. This has also meant that travelling for workshops has become less important - saving the business money.
User: Obviously the pandemic force a lot of us to find new ways to collaborate and connect without being face to face. Miro was clearly ahead of the game in this regard. But even since we're seeing more of each other in the flesh, miro still seems to be adding value with how easy it ease to document workshops, quickly capture ideas, and bring people together to brainstorm.
User: There are very few things to dislike about miro. There are some very minor things like how tables not being incredibly user-friendly, limitations in how you can modify shapes (particularly for the sake of creating wireframes). But all in all, this stuff is nice to have and the fact that you can even do basic wire framing along side everything else that you can do is a win.","Users appreciate Miro's ability to align remote meeting participants and create engaging, self-documenting workshops. The speed and fluidity of the application enhance the facilitator experience.

Example: I have a button that is a frame with a blue background which is tied to a color style.

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi,
Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior. I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a ‚ÄúSpecial offer‚Äù label placed inside the picture.
In order to reproduce the issue:
Step 1: Create a text field, turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color, just to create a label basically, like ‚ÄúFLASH SALE‚Äù etc‚Ä¶
Step 2: Add a rectangle and fill it with an image.
Step 3: Turn both into an Auto-Layout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside. While doing so, you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it, even when the label layer is above the image.
Despite that, when merging a text and an image into Auto-Layout and only then turning the text to Auto-Layout as well to give if a fill color - this method works perfectly fine, but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned, so there might be a bug here. Or is it?

Be a rebel üëá <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd This allows us - in theory - to browse any website.
(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""
Install it. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry ""Custom Frames"" (towards end of your list)

The new entry will appear in the list above the button. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL (<STRICT_LINK>, <STRICT_LINK> or <STRICT_LINK> - copy &amp; paste from Browser)
2 ‚úÖ ""open in center"" to open the service like a tab (otherwise it's in the sidebar)
3 ‚úÖ ""Add Ribbon Icon"" to display a side icon. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Specify the icon you want to use.

Copy paste it's name into the ""icon"" textfield in previous step. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left.
You will have to log in to Google/Apple/Evernote/... the first time. But then it will remember you. (Just like in a browser)
On the top right you find a few buttons, to reload the page. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Summary:

‚ñ∫ Add frames to any website, as Obsidian is technically a browser.

Be a rebel üëá <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd This allows us - in theory - to browse any website.
(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""
Install it. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry ""Custom Frames"" (towards end of your list)
Find the ""New Frame"" button and click it. A Frame is such a browser window, that we can use to access all of the services.
The new entry will appear in the list above the button. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL (<STRICT_LINK>, <STRICT_LINK> or <STRICT_LINK> - copy &amp; paste from Browser)
2 ‚úÖ ""open in center"" to open the service like a tab (otherwise it's in the sidebar)
3 ‚úÖ ""Add Ribbon Icon"" to display a side icon. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Specify the icon you want to use.
Go to <STRICT_LINK> and find an icon you like.
Copy paste it's name into the ""icon"" textfield in previous step. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left.
You will have to log in to Google/Apple/Evernote/... the first time. But then it will remember you. (Just like in a browser)
On the top right you find a few buttons, to reload the page. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Summary:
‚ñ∫ Download ""Custom Frames"" plugin
‚ñ∫ Add frames to any website, as Obsidian is technically a browser.
‚ñ∫ This technique works with ANY website. So you can integrate google calendar, facebook or a todo app into obsidian!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Obsidian is THE note-taking app to rule them all.

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi, I believe I‚Äôve exhausted all the existing help articles on this.
I‚Äôm having a hard time with something that should be very basic. I have 25 or so screens, the ONLY interaction between them is that the user should be able to click and/or press the arrow key to navigate LINEARLY between them.
Sometimes it works (especially if I go slowly, it works every time). But sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, sometimes it inexplicably jumps through sections (pretty much only happens if I press the arrow keys quickly). It appears that if I click through it goes linearly every time without skipping screens. So the problem is only with the arrow keys (which I can‚Äôt disable so I need to understand the behavior before handing off to my client).
I‚Äôve adjusted all the artboards. The desired order is Row 1 Left to Right, Row 2 Left to Right (as described in the documentation). All rows have the exact same Y coordinate. All columns have the exact same X coordinate.
I‚Äôve spent hours on this already and this is really basic behavior so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so hard, I want it to act like powerpoint in presentation mode.
Any help is appreciated. I can‚Äôt really share the prototype because I‚Äôm on NDA.
User: Or up vote the solution here‚Ä¶
 
 
 
 Remove auto creating flow starting points Share an idea
 
 
 I love the new feature that allows multiple prototypes per page. One issue I‚Äôm having with it, is it assumes I want everything to be a new flow starting point each time I don‚Äôt link something from the first flow starting page. 
It has a very linear mindset. When I work/prototype I tend to work on a section, then link it back and that creates many flow starting points on accident and I have to delete them. 
It‚Äôd be nice if either - it only created the first one, and doesn‚Äôt assume you want many o‚Ä¶

When publishing a library I have to uncheck styles that are not meant to be published, and I have to do it every time I publish. Sometimes I accidentally publish styles that were meant to help speed up my work within a file, but that were not meant to be a part of the library. It would be helpful to have an option similar to what I‚Äôve added in the mock-up above. I‚Äôd like to be able to toggle whether or not a style is meant to be a published style.
On a similar note, it would be helpful not only to see which items have changed in the library when I publish, but also what has changed specifically about those items.

Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi, I believe I‚Äôve exhausted all the existing help articles on this.
I‚Äôm having a hard time with something that should be very basic. I have 25 or so screens, the ONLY interaction between them is that the user should be able to click and/or press the arrow key to navigate LINEARLY between them.
Sometimes it works (especially if I go slowly, it works every time). But sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, sometimes it inexplicably jumps through sections (pretty much only happens if I press the arrow keys quickly). It appears that if I click through it goes linearly every time without skipping screens. So the problem is only with the arrow keys (which I can‚Äôt disable so I need to understand the behavior before handing off to my client).
I‚Äôve adjusted all the artboards. The desired order is Row 1 Left to Right, Row 2 Left to Right (as described in the documentation). All rows have the exact same Y coordinate. All columns have the exact same X coordinate.
I‚Äôve spent hours on this already and this is really basic behavior so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so hard, I want it to act like powerpoint in presentation mode.
Any help is appreciated. I can‚Äôt really share the prototype because I‚Äôm on NDA.

 I love the new feature that allows multiple prototypes per page. One issue I‚Äôm having with it, is it assumes I want everything to be a new flow starting point each time I don‚Äôt link something from the first flow starting page. 
It has a very linear mindset. When I work/prototype I tend to work on a section, then link it back and that creates many flow starting points on accident and I have to delete them. 
It‚Äôd be nice if either - it only created the first one, and doesn‚Äôt assume you want many o‚Ä¶

User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay

User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd This allows us - in theory - to browse any website.
(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""
Install it. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry ""Custom Frames"" (towards end of your list)
Find the ""New Frame"" button and click it. A Frame is such a browser window, that we can use to access all of the services.
The new entry will appear in the list above the button. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL (<STRICT_LINK>, <STRICT_LINK> or <STRICT_LINK> - copy &amp; paste from Browser)
2 ‚úÖ ""open in center"" to open the service like a tab (otherwise it's in the sidebar)
3 ‚úÖ ""Add Ribbon Icon"" to display a side icon. <STRICT_LINK>

Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left.
You will have to log in to Google/Apple/Evernote/... the first time. But then it will remember you. (Just like in a browser)
On the top right you find a few buttons, to reload the page. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Summary:
‚ñ∫ Download ""Custom Frames"" plugin
‚ñ∫ Add frames to any website, as Obsidian is technically a browser.
‚ñ∫ This technique works with ANY website. So you can integrate google calendar, facebook or a todo app into obsidian!

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi all, I am working on a Figma plugin that needs to import style from our team library. Through research I think the way is to first use Figma REST API to get the keys of styles from our library file, and the use figma.importStyleByKeyAsync() to import the style. However, the issue is, this requires me to put my Access token in the plugin, and I don‚Äôt want to. Is there a way for plugin to authenticate when making REST API calls on behalf of the person who uses the plugin?
Or are there any other easier ways to import/access styles from team library file in plugin? Thanks a lot!!!
User: You have several ways:
Users will create their own personal access tokens, which will be inserted into the input field of your plugin.
Users will open the necessary library files, run the plugin there to get the necessary keys, return to another file to continue working.
Hardcode the keys in the plugin.
3.1. Or add these keys to, for example, a JSON file that you or anyone else can keep updating as needed.

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi, I believe I‚Äôve exhausted all the existing help articles on this.
I‚Äôm having a hard time with something that should be very basic. I have 25 or so screens, the ONLY interaction between them is that the user should be able to click and/or press the arrow key to navigate LINEARLY between them.
Sometimes it works (especially if I go slowly, it works every time). But sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, sometimes it inexplicably jumps through sections (pretty much only happens if I press the arrow keys quickly). It appears that if I click through it goes linearly every time without skipping screens. So the problem is only with the arrow keys (which I can‚Äôt disable so I need to understand the behavior before handing off to my client).
I‚Äôve adjusted all the artboards. The desired order is Row 1 Left to Right, Row 2 Left to Right (as described in the documentation). All rows have the exact same Y coordinate. All columns have the exact same X coordinate.
I‚Äôve spent hours on this already and this is really basic behavior so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so hard, I want it to act like powerpoint in presentation mode.
Any help is appreciated. I can‚Äôt really share the prototype because I‚Äôm on NDA.

 Remove auto creating flow starting points Share an idea
 
 
 I love the new feature that allows multiple prototypes per page. One issue I‚Äôm having with it, is it assumes I want everything to be a new flow starting point each time I don‚Äôt link something from the first flow starting page. 
It has a very linear mindset. When I work/prototype I tend to work on a section, then link it back and that creates many flow starting points on accident and I have to delete them. 
It‚Äôd be nice if either - it only created the first one, and doesn‚Äôt assume you want many o‚Ä¶

Turning off ‚Äúsnap to pixel grid‚Äù in a Figma Design file no longer changes snapping behavior when dragging frames around.

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: I'm not a big planner to begin with, probably due to my lack of enjoyment for more mainstream planners like Google calendar and traditional paper planners.

Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality. It provided helpful templates I could use to give an overall format for what I wanted to write (checklists, boxes, etc.) which were incredibly customizable.

figma,G2,"User: Miro has the power to aggregate what has been shared among multiple tools. In addition, it has the potential to allow multiple people to work at the same time without any problems, and it has been used in seminars and training sessions, and has been very popular. In the training that I participate in, training using miro is increasing, and it is very useful to visualize the result of the discussion in a short time.
User: Miro is easier to use than an actual whiteboard. In particular, it's easy to attach, write, move, and connect sticky notes, and it automatically corrects the connection lines, so you can use it more efficiently than an actual whiteboard. So you can focus on the discussion. Also, miro is great for sharing information you create online, ensuring that the same image information is conveyed. As a comparison to other similar tools, it's nice to have reaction features, icons, and formatting that you can't use up.
User: The disadvantage of miro is that the access can be quite slow depending on the board. When you first open a board with a lot of information on it, you often have to wait a few 10 seconds. I hope that this problem will be solved by devising means such as image processing centered on the area where the display priority is being determined. Also, if you just use it, you don't have a chance to see new or useful functions, so I think it would be good if you were shown it by a pop-up (This feature may already exist and you may have turned it off yourself, but it is true that it does not appear at this time.).","The user appreciates Figma for its ease of use in remote and hybrid teams, allowing for asynchronous problem-solving and accessible designs.

Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.

Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay

One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)
<STRICT_LINK>
User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space?
E.g. my Slack always open links in my work space/profile?
I'm logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces.
User: @JiriJerabek @browsercompany Great question. Not right now, but this feature for link routing by Space is coming in a couple weeks üëÄ
Can't wait to hear what you think!","
 The user is enjoying the new features in Arc, including the split view, sidebar, and the ability to pin folders. They are also impressed with the iOS app, which allows them to open links in specific spaces. However, they are concerned about the lack of a mobile app and the lack of a way to tell apps to open links in specific spaces.",0.42515191435813904

figma,G2,"User: It replaced physical whiteboards for discovery and brainstorming sessions. It also works as an excellent ice-breaker and teambuilding tool to have everyone active during meetings or learning sessions.
User: For those who miss physical whiteboards and post-its this is the solution to easily (and virtually) visualize projects and organize brainstorming, project management and workflow visualization. It's very friendly, intuitive and compatible with other tools.
User: Some toolboxes usually overlap important information, and sharing options are not that easy to understand and use, mainly with external (not frequent) users.","Users find Miro to be an effective collaboration tool that helps run meetings smoothly, reduces manual work, and saves costs.

figma,G2,"User: Another problem that Miro solves is the challenge of sharing complex ideas in a simple way. Miro's range of templates, diagrams, and sticky notes make it easy to share ideas visually, which can be especially helpful for projects that require a lot of detail or complexity. This has allowed me to communicate my ideas more effectively with my team members, resulting in better collaboration and a more efficient workflow.
User: I have found Miro to be an incredibly powerful tool for collaborating with teams. One of the things I like best about Miro is how easy it is to use. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it simple to get started even for those who are not particularly tech-savvy. 
The real-time collaboration features in Miro are also incredibly helpful. Multiple team members can work on a board simultaneously, which helps to streamline the collaborative process and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features, such as templates, sticky notes, and diagrams, are highly customizable, allowing for greater flexibility when working on projects.
User: One thing that I have found to be a drawback of Miro is its pricing structure. While the platform offers a free plan, its more advanced features are only available with paid plans, which may be expensive for smaller teams or individuals. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users, and it may take some time to learn how to use everything effectively. However, Miro's support resources, including video tutorials and a user community, are quite helpful in getting up to speed quickly.",The user loves FigJam for its ease of use and prefers it over multiple apps for conceptualizing ideas and storyboards. They have not used any other whiteboarding app and cannot identify any limitations.,0.34067302942276
figma,G2,"User: Miro solves two huge problems for me. 
 
1. Remote working and having collaborative sessions with other team members. Before I found Miro, having these sessions was incredibly hard 
2. When you write on a whiteboard, at some stage it gets rubbed off. Miro you can have endless whiteboards that you never need to delete
User: Miro is incredibly helpful for a number of reasons. The best way to look at it is like a whiteboard with all the relevant tools, online. You can use it for brainstorming sessions, mapping customer journeys, comparing notes and heaps more. It feels like I have only just scraped the surface with what is possible on Miro.
User: Honestly, there aren't many downsides to using Miro. The hardest part is probably getting use to it and understanding what you should use for certain things. Maybe some more tutorials would be helpful.","The user finds Figma helpful for design creation, review, and QA purposes, appreciating its easy-to-understand UI and simple commenting system.

Notion,Twitter,"User: **Arc browser continuous review**
Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)
<STRICT_LINK>
User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space?
E.g. my Slack always open links in my work space/profile?
I'm logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces.
User: @JiriJerabek @browsercompany Great question. Not right now, but this feature for link routing by Space is coming in a couple weeks üëÄ

figma,Twitter,"User: We want to start using versioning in our projects and we are trying to figure out the best way to do it.
The approach that makes more sense to us is to create a new branch on each file for the new version.
Our issue is that we have team members working on each version (1 and 2) but we can‚Äôt create a new feature branch for the version 2 branch (we don‚Äôt have this issue for version 1 because that is the main branch).
Our question is if does exist an official way to work with different versions in the same file in order to handle versioning or if there is a better way to do this.
Example of what we need
Button v1 branch (main)
a new feature for Button v1 (a new branch from the main branch)
Button v2 branch (version 2 branch)
a new feature for Button v2 (a new branch from version 2 branch)

Paper planners I encountered in the store didn't do the job either because they were not formatted exactly how I wanted, and of course a regular old notebook didn't provide the online accessibility I wanted.
Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality. It provided helpful templates I could use to give an overall format for what I wanted to write (checklists, boxes, etc.) which were incredibly customizable. The tool is simple yet powerful, without any unnecessary visual effects or special features you are forced to learn. I love that Notion can be accessed on any device via the website or app, and my plans look the exact same in any format without shifting its orientation or completely up-hauling the website layout. I would recommend this to anyone.","User finds Notion helpful for organizing their daily tasks and planning their week, as it provides templates and customizable tools for organizing their tasks.

Notion,Twitter,"User: **Arc browser continuous review**
Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)
<STRICT_LINK>
User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space?
E.g. my Slack always open links in my work space/profile?

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi there, I am currently laying the foundations for a Design Language System. At the same time another team is working on the first of a series of Apps. My intention is to take the components that they create for that first app and then add them to the design system, so we can re-use elements for all the future Apps
The DLS and the the first App will be created as two separate design files within the same project. My hope was that at various intervals I would be able to copy and paste content from the App into the DLS then publish the library from the DLS and get the other team to use the library swap feature to swap their local components with those from the DLS published library.
But my initial tests lead me to believe that this isn‚Äôt possible. It seems that you can only use library swap on two externally published libraries rather than an external library (the DLS) and a local library (the App). Is this the case?
If so, what is the suggested workflow in this situation?
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks

User: 2/12 First up, we use @NotionHQ . It's our hub for everything. Tasks, deadlines, management ‚Äì it's all there. It works like a charm to keep everything organised, especially when working when a team it‚Äôs nice, since everyone knows what‚Äôs where.
User: 3/12 Next, Slack. We use this mainly for internal communication with the team and for communication with a few clients. In the beginning we wanted to use Slack 100% for clients communication, but some clients just don‚Äôt like it, and we don‚Äôt want to force them haha.
User: 4/12 We also use Monday, it's our CRM where we track leads and conversions, basically keeping our clients in the loop. We used to do this in Notion, but it was hard to use which made it less motivating to keep it up to date.
User: 5/12 @zapier is our go-to for automation. It takes care of all the repeat stuff, so we have more time to be creative. Nothing special, but is saves a lot of time.
User: 6/12 For crafting copy we use @OpenAI's ChatGPT. Before GPT released we were actually using a tool called Jasper a year ago, it was around 100USD a month and delivered 30% of the results GPT offers for free, a real game changer.
User: 7/12 @webflow is the platform we use to built our website with, which integrates seamlessly with all our other tools through Zapier.
