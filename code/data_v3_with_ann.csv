Me They ALL run INSIDE my obsdmd  
Be a rebel  
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called Electron
Electron is just a Chrome browser that runs like an app on your desktop
So essentially Obsidian  Snazzy Browser for your notes
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd This allows us  in theory  to browse any website
In practice it works 80 of the time hence I couldnt get it to work with tana_inc or logseq 
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box  with a plugin its easy Lets get to it
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Go to Settings gt Community Plugins Search for Custom Frames
Install it 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry Custom Frames towards end of your list
Find the New Frame button and click it A Frame is such a browser window that we can use to access all of the services
The new entry will appear in the list above the button 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL   or   copy amp paste from Browser
2  open in center to open the service like a tab otherwise its in the sidebar
3  Add Ribbon Icon to display a side icon 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq Specify the icon you want to use
Go to  and find an icon you like
Copy paste its name into the icon textfield in previous step 
googledocs evernote NotionHQ RoamResearch obsdmd tana_inc logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left
You will have to log in to GoogleAppleEvernote the first time But then it will remember you Just like in a browser
On the top right you find a few buttons to reload the page

zoom,Appstore/Playstore,"Ive been a designer for a little over 13 years Early in my design career I started feeling like I wanted a more technical role and switched to frontend development
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for me
At the time I was building custom WordPress themes 
Within my theme Id have a partials folder full of my silly little components
And I had my templates folder full of my silly little templates
Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular maintainable and organised template files
Seeing it all come together was a huge aha moment for me but I didnt know why  at the time design systems wasnt a wellknown concept
I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass extending classes using mixins and all that fun CSS goodness

Looking back at it now I realise that what I was really kind of doing was implementing a simplified version of component properties
Code felt natural and intuitive  I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly But design tooling wasnt anywhere close to what it is now
Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying pasting and replacing The process felt outdated and ineffective and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code even the tiniest bit
When I learned about Figma a few years later it felt like a huge weight had been lifted and my passion for design exploded
Im so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly and some of the gaps between designdev are starting to thin out
This was a lot of tweets about nothing but I woke up feeling so in love with my career 
And just generally grateful that I get to sit around all day working on design systems architecting components crafting design patterns and collaborating with developers 
I dont think Id be so passionate about my career if figma didnt come around when it did  Its setting the standard of things to come and were only at the beginning ",Nothing,389,1,0.021739130434782608,0.025408631190657616

Notion,Twitter,"After using the AI tool for a while I ran into some issues and also found some toolsplatforms suitable for lazy people
Lets read the conclusion first I recommend the poe_platform platform The supported bots are also quite rich There are no IP requirements and if you have advanced requirements you can directly subscribe on the Poe platform
ChatGPT 
Currently I mainly use Claudes robot on the Poe platform Heres a summary of the advantages Ive discovered
1 Responses will be faster than ChatGPT in Chinese conversations
2 The corpus will be updated in due course I dont know the frequency but at least he can help me sort out the relatively new content Layer2 and Starknet
3 Writing and copywriting skills seem to be stronger than ChatGPT subjective feeling
Lets take a look at other AI tool products in detail
1chatGPT
There are strict restrictions on IP and a global proxyprivacy window must be attached to it before it can be used
There are unstable situations For example I went to WeChat to send a message to him halfway through the conversation and when I came back I had to refresh the page before I could use it
There are occasional interruptions in answering so I need to remind him to continue
In the end he blocked me which is the biggest problem with using it so far 

2Google Bard Google fought back against OpenAIs products Currently I havent been able to experience them due to IP issues so I abandoned them according to the purpose of our lazy people According to feedback from some friends there is still a certain gap between product power and ChatGPT

3Claude
The founder is the former executive vice president of OpenAI This product is very popular in the investment community Its a bit like the capital that didnt invest in Tesla back then placed a heavy bet on Lucid
Its currently completely free to use and supports use of  on Poe and Slack
4Poe
This is an integrated platform made by Quora that supports mainstream AI conversation tools GPT4 and Claude paid subscriptions are also supported
Its the best toolplatform to use so far and you can use it without having to connect to a global agent or open a ladder

5BuddyGPT
This is a GPT robot on Telegram which will be more friendly to heavy TG users Theres a free version but it only supports 10 free messages per month and the subscription costs 599month

6Defalsh
Web3 content aggregation platform with GPT as the information processing engine
There is no need to register and you can use it with authorization through the Metamask wallet Although the introduction says Web3 content aggregation platform it doesnt seem to support onchain data retrieval yet so Im still looking forward to them becoming a Web3 onestop search engine
There seems to be a plan to issue NFTs in the future which is considered a crossborder product

7Notion AI
NotionHQs builtin AI function can help users automatically organize notes correct typos list article highlights translate create tables etc
Suitable for scenarios such as copywriting studying etc
There are free trials and the subscription costs 10month

The DLS and the the first App will be created as two separate design files within the same project My hope was that at various intervals I would be able to copy and paste content from the App into the DLS then publish the library from the DLS and get the other team to use the library swap feature to swap their local components with those from the DLS published library
But my initial tests lead me to believe that this isnt possible It seems that you can only use library swap on two externally published libraries rather than an external library the DLS and a local library the App Is this the case
If so what is the suggested workflow in this situation

zoom,Appstore/Playstore,"Hi there I am currently laying the foundations for a Design Language System At the same time another team is working on the first of a series of Apps My intention is to take the components that they create for that first app and then add them to the design system so we can reuse elements for all the future Apps
The DLS and the the first App will be created as two separate design files within the same project My hope was that at various intervals I would be able to copy and paste content from the App into the DLS then publish the library from the DLS and get the other team to use the library swap feature to swap their local components with those from the DLS published library
But my initial tests lead me to believe that this isnt possible It seems that you can only use library swap on two externally published libraries rather than an external library the DLS and a local library the App Is this the case
If so what is the suggested workflow in this situation
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated Many thanks

figma,Twitter," How to turn an almost perfect UIUX to perfect
Using  as a perfect example created by cnnr_cllhn 
cnnr_cllhn LoseTheVery is a fantastic tool that finds a more concise adjective without using very Example very rich  affluent
The core idea is simple and the UI was chosen to reflect that Its straight to the point just like the Google Search homepage So whats the problem 
cnnr_cllhn  There are 3 main flaws
1 Site feels messy
2 Design lacks consistency
3 Elements feel a little too cramped
Well approach it via negativa style by removing stuff rather than adding
 Lets work on that that using figma
cnnr_cllhn figma 1 Decluttering 
The most important step would be to remove the clutter  the annoying newsletter popup the newsletter section and the newsletter banner Well get back to it later
This has already made a difference The interface looks significantly cleaner 
cnnr_cllhn figma 2 Let the design breathe 
Lets add more whitespace  the more the better This will achieve a better visual separation
Now the very  x  y line instantly grabs our attention 
cnnr_cllhn figma 3 Making buttons prettier 
Buttons look chaotic here randomly spaced different padding etc
Lets increase the font size adjust the padding and replace the word random with a dice icon Well also invert the third button
The buttons now look modern and consistent 
cnnr_cllhn figma 4 Typography 
The typography is a mess 4 diffrent typefaces on one page Lets reduce our typeface choices to just 2 Well leave the sans font but lets choose a different serif font
I would choose a humanist style serif Lets go with Crimson Pro ",Celebrating educators in the Figma for Edu community for Teacher Appreciation Week.,270,12,0.46153846153846156,0.0915619283914566

zoom,Appstore/Playstore,"Arc browser continuous review
Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space
Eg my Slack always open links in my work spaceprofile
Im logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces
JiriJerabek browsercompany Great question Not right now but this feature for link routing by Space is coming in a couple weeks

zoom,Appstore/Playstore,"10 tools I use every week as a product manager
1 asana 
This is our tool of choice when it comes to organizing work throughout the company
Simple but powerful it does everything we need to keep our teams organized and our work visible
2 MiroHQ 
Ive been using Miro for everything lately product briefs data analyses brainstorming mockups 
Its a tool that can do a ton of things well and helps make visuals much easier to consume vs a document
3 Looker
Weve used Looker for several years and its our goto spot for building reports and dashboards
Our core team dashboard and pricingconversion dashboards both live here and I check each daily
4 Amplitude_HQ 
For product analytics we use Amplitude Looker gives me highlevel business metrics Amplitude gives me the details
We use this for understanding the user behavior behind the metrics
5 CrazyEgg amp hotjar 
Two tools that do similar things we use one for our website and one for our app
These give us even more qualitative data behind our metrics with things like heat maps and screen recordings
6 SlackHQ 
I barely use email any more and while the Slack overload is real it does enable fast async communication among our teams wherever we are
Its also great for consolidating notifications from other tools Asana Google Docs etc if you set up the integrations
7 Officevibe 
Our HR team implemented this tool and as PM it gives me a bunch of metrics about how my team is doing
It gives me some data backing for how the team is feeling and shows me when I might need to spend time on morale
8 figma 
Miro is great for lofi prototypes and brainstorming but at some point it moves to Figma

Everything seemed good but when I tried to preview it it would keep opening and closing rapidly as I moved my mouse over the selected navigation title Shop
Here is the link to the file 
Thanks for the help guys
Hi there
So I guess whats happening is that the prototype gets stuck between a situation where its opening an overlay because the mouse is on Shop and also closing the overlay because if the mouse has left Shop then it should close This is why it seems to flicker To fix this Id recommend using interactive components instead of the Overlay feature An example of what Im talking about is in the community file
Hope this helps

This helped a lot with the issue but it started another one  So now the issue is that the dropdown now will not close after the mouse is off of it and the navigation title moves up with the dropdown making it disappear from the screen I copied pretty much everything from the figma file you sent me and tried to fix it but couldnt find a solution

So Im trying to recreate the wwwpandaexpresscom website and im with the banner part
 
 
 
 
 
My steps are
Create the base structure
Group it
Duplicate it
Adjust the circle and image for second asset
Make it interactive from prototype tab
Create a component set
On the Design Frame i add the component and it went crazy with the line that dragged into the previous asset frame And when i present it none of my clicks works with the banner Ive cross checked the prototyped and Ive selected the on click
Can anyone please correct me on which step did I do wrong
Thankyou
Only link the two variants together within the component Dont also link the component or any of its variants to the instance of that component
Another thing might be the way you created the component Id make the two states first then make them both components then select them both and click Combine as variants in the right panel then prototype the variants together within the component

figma,Twitter,"Its known the text line hight its a nightmare However Im struggling with the text box hight even more with Figma Auto Layout
image29661878 323 KB
image38961958 419 KB
When giving padding on Figma autolayout to a button the text position inside the box not the box is not in the centre height In the following example you can see that in one font type there is 2 px space at the bottom and 1 at the top and in the other one 2px at the top and 1 at the bottom
Thats led to 1 the text is not in the centre height 2 the padding is getting extra which then lead to the wrong implementation
Later on CSS the text div wont behave like that and will wrap right around the text
The ideal is that the space padding above and below the text is even and exactly as set in the padding
Is anyone have a solution for this challenge
I am having the exact same issue to the point that I thought I wrote this post  We are trying to define fonts text box behavior and autolayout for a design system so this is a serious problem
There is more space above the ascender than there is below the descender Ideally it should be equal

Here is skew If thats all I do it works

Miro is easier to use than an actual whiteboard In particular its easy to attach write move and connect sticky notes and it automatically corrects the connection lines so you can use it more efficiently than an actual whiteboard So you can focus on the discussion Also miro is great for sharing information you create online ensuring that the same image information is conveyed As a comparison to other similar tools its nice to have reaction features icons and formatting that you cant use up
The disadvantage of miro is that the access can be quite slow depending on the board When you first open a board with a lot of information on it you often have to wait a few 10 seconds I hope that this problem will be solved by devising means such as image processing centered on the area where the display priority is being determined Also if you just use it you dont have a chance to see new or useful functions so I think it would be good if you were shown it by a popup This feature may already exist and you may have turned it off yourself but it is true that it does not appear at this time","The user appreciates Miro's versatility, comparing it to a whiteboard that is easy for everyone to use, with features like screenshots repositories, markups, user flows, and progress boards.

1 asana 
This is our tool of choice when it comes to organizing work throughout the company
Simple but powerful it does everything we need to keep our teams organized and our work visible
2 MiroHQ 
Ive been using Miro for everything lately product briefs data analyses brainstorming mockups 
Its a tool that can do a ton of things well and helps make visuals much easier to consume vs a document
3 Looker
Weve used Looker for several years and its our goto spot for building reports and dashboards
Our core team dashboard and pricingconversion dashboards both live here and I check each daily
4 Amplitude_HQ 
For product analytics we use Amplitude Looker gives me highlevel business metrics Amplitude gives me the details
We use this for understanding the user behavior behind the metrics
5 CrazyEgg amp hotjar 
Two tools that do similar things we use one for our website and one for our app
These give us even more qualitative data behind our metrics with things like heat maps and screen recordings
6 SlackHQ 
I barely use email any more and while the Slack overload is real it does enable fast async communication among our teams wherever we are
Its also great for consolidating notifications from other tools Asana Google Docs etc if you set up the integrations
7 Officevibe 
Our HR team implemented this tool and as PM it gives me a bunch of metrics about how my team is doing
It gives me some data backing for how the team is feeling and shows me when I might need to spend time on morale

FigJams simplicity and ease of use enables fast mapping and sharing of complex systems and dependencies Ive recently created several sprawling figjam charts that outline marketing programs from beginning to end for our clients They have been so helpful keeping the team informed at a high level and are a great reference to regularly huddle around 
 
This is just one kind of use  because of its flexibility you can begin to discover ways to think and present ideas large or small Create fast design mockups review and provide feedback on designs create storyboards  the list can go on and on Easily shareable to anyone with little to no trouble with login attempts or dealing with incompatible file types 
 
It feels so freeing to break from the clunky confines of a ppt slide with its bad clip art and boring bullet points Expanding across an endless canvas allows us to combat any confusion or anxiety that tends to show up around building complex marketing campaigns

And hey presto 2 weeks later he answers it in this famous video

2 A video where he films himself in a photo booth from his Mac desktop which allows him to browse his Finder and show content images sounds videos etc by unfolding his story Funny with a touch of brothelartisan
 
This format was called videofile_ and allows browsercompany to tell its new features and the philosophy behind each time being embodied by an employee not just the CEO And given the engagement rates thats interesting 
2 other videos that were a hit  a metavideo where the CEO watches and reacts to a review of his browser by one of the biggest tech influencers MKBHD Its THE most popular video with 343K views Skilled at surfing on his visibility

Notion,Twitter,"After using the AI tool for a while I ran into some issues and also found some toolsplatforms suitable for lazy people
Lets read the conclusion first I recommend the poe_platform platform The supported bots are also quite rich There are no IP requirements and if you have advanced requirements you can directly subscribe on the Poe platform
ChatGPT 
Currently I mainly use Claudes robot on the Poe platform Heres a summary of the advantages Ive discovered
1 Responses will be faster than ChatGPT in Chinese conversations
2 The corpus will be updated in due course I dont know the frequency but at least he can help me sort out the relatively new content Layer2 and Starknet
3 Writing and copywriting skills seem to be stronger than ChatGPT subjective feeling
Lets take a look at other AI tool products in detail
1chatGPT
There are strict restrictions on IP and a global proxyprivacy window must be attached to it before it can be used
There are unstable situations For example I went to WeChat to send a message to him halfway through the conversation and when I came back I had to refresh the page before I could use it
There are occasional interruptions in answering so I need to remind him to continue
In the end he blocked me which is the biggest problem with using it so far 

2Google Bard Google fought back against OpenAIs products Currently I havent been able to experience them due to IP issues so I abandoned them according to the purpose of our lazy people According to feedback from some friends there is still a certain gap between product power and ChatGPT

3Claude
The founder is the former executive vice president of OpenAI This product is very popular in the investment community Its a bit like the capital that didnt invest in Tesla back then placed a heavy bet on Lucid
Its currently completely free to use and supports use of  on Poe and Slack
4Poe
This is an integrated platform made by Quora that supports mainstream AI conversation tools GPT4 and Claude paid subscriptions are also supported
Its the best toolplatform to use so far and you can use it without having to connect to a global agent or open a ladder

5BuddyGPT
This is a GPT robot on Telegram which will be more friendly to heavy TG users Theres a free version but it only supports 10 free messages per month and the subscription costs 599month

6Defalsh
Web3 content aggregation platform with GPT as the information processing engine
There is no need to register and you can use it with authorization through the Metamask wallet Although the introduction says Web3 content aggregation platform it doesnt seem to support onchain data retrieval yet so Im still looking forward to them becoming a Web3 onestop search engine
There seems to be a plan to issue NFTs in the future which is considered a crossborder product

7Notion AI
NotionHQs builtin AI function can help users automatically organize notes correct typos list article highlights translate create tables etc
Suitable for scenarios such as copywriting studying etc
There are free trials and the subscription costs 10month

Possible solutions
There are a couple of solutions that solve this issue but still are not optimal
Have multiple absolutely identical components to nest one into another

For the upperlevel use a component with more placeholders inside and hide unnecessary ones

I think the only solution for now is to create a  Main Container component with  slot instances inside Then you need to create also another component for  ColumnRow with variants With this you can upto 2nd level only Unless yo create a similar column component with different name

Describe the problem your experiencing and how your idea helps solve this
When you create an autolayout frame it always defaults to 10px Many design systems call for an 8px grid and in many cases users dont want ANY padding especially where edgetoedge designs are concerned
Ask questions to bring the community into the conversation
What are everyones thoughts about the following solutions
Default autolayout padding based on the big nudge amount in your settings
Allow for tokenization of paddingmargin grids and offer up autolayout parameters based upon those tokens
Allow users to override the padding to 0px at the creation of the autolayout frame by using an alternative key command like ctrlshifta command on mac

Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"This app worked fine as a free user however after becoming a subscribed member I ran into some annoying and suspicious issues I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes Of course theres a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer I paid 499 for the one month subscription but it wont actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe but I already have The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay
My app says I am a subscribed member so why is it denying me member benefits I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone restarting the app deleting and downloading the app again logging out and then back in etc Nothing has worked so far Not only do I feel robbed but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses but after subscribing it sends me straight to the subscription choice page That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it regardless of if that is actually the case or not Looking through some of the other lower reviews I am not the only one who has ran into this problem Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for
Summary I paid for premium but the app isnt letting me actually use premium benefits
Thank you Frustrated Notion User","User experienced issues with the app not allowing them to use the AI program after subscribing, despite having paid for it.

Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a Special offer label placed inside the picture
In order to reproduce the issue
Step 1 Create a text field turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color just to create a label basically like FLASH SALE etc
Step 2 Add a rectangle and fill it with an image
Step 3 Turn both into an AutoLayout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside While doing so you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it even when the label layer is above the image
Despite that when merging a text and an image into AutoLayout and only then turning the text to AutoLayout as well to give if a fill color  this method works perfectly fine but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned so there might be a bug here Or is it

figma,Twitter,"We want to start using versioning in our projects and we are trying to figure out the best way to do it
The approach that makes more sense to us is to create a new branch on each file for the new version
Our issue is that we have team members working on each version 1 and 2 but we cant create a new feature branch for the version 2 branch we dont have this issue for version 1 because that is the main branch
Our question is if does exist an official way to work with different versions in the same file in order to handle versioning or if there is a better way to do this
Example of what we need
Button v1 branch main
a new feature for Button v1 a new branch from the main branch
Button v2 branch version 2 branch
a new feature for Button v2 a new branch from version 2 branch

figma,Twitter,"Hi I have an using when using the Figma
When I disable the Chrome Hardware acceleration I am able to open the Figma without any issue albeit slower
But when I enable the chrome hardware acceleration setting everytime I open Figma my browser will flicker once and says that my browser did not support WEBGL
Is there anyway to fix it
I need to enable the hardware acceleration for other chrome features But then I wont be able to use Figma if I do so
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files
If this is happening on a specific file then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits
Figma is a browserbased app which means its subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab including those in our Desktop App When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes
I recommend you to
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages for example by splitting a page into multiple pages will usually help with rendering performance
Hidden layers loading and then hiding a large number of layers especially in components or with images stored in them can cause a high use of available memory on loading
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here Hope it helps
Hi Celine_Doan
Its happening to all files actually
Which is weird since i can still access all files without issue if i turned the browser hardware acceleration off
i also tried using my other laptop with the hardware acceleration on to open all the files and it does not have the same issue
Hi Tsasqa_Galih 
Thank you for the details
Can you also ensure WebGL is enabled in Google Chrome The steps to do this are in this article 
If it is still doesnt fix your issue please reach out to the team by filling this form with all detail you recall WEBGL issue happening to all files affecting browser andor desktop etc here
Our technical team can investigate further Thank you

figma,Twitter,"Ive been a designer for a little over 13 years Early in my design career I started feeling like I wanted a more technical role and switched to frontend development
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for me
At the time I was building custom WordPress themes 
Within my theme Id have a partials folder full of my silly little components
And I had my templates folder full of my silly little templates
Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular maintainable and organised template files
Seeing it all come together was a huge aha moment for me but I didnt know why  at the time design systems wasnt a wellknown concept
I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass extending classes using mixins and all that fun CSS goodness

Looking back at it now I realise that what I was really kind of doing was implementing a simplified version of component properties
Code felt natural and intuitive  I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly But design tooling wasnt anywhere close to what it is now
Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying pasting and replacing The process felt outdated and ineffective and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code even the tiniest bit
When I learned about Figma a few years later it felt like a huge weight had been lifted and my passion for design exploded
Im so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly and some of the gaps between designdev are starting to thin out
This was a lot of tweets about nothing but I woke up feeling so in love with my career 
And just generally grateful that I get to sit around all day working on design systems architecting components crafting design patterns and collaborating with developers 
I dont think Id be so passionate about my career if figma didnt come around when it did  Its setting the standard of things to come and were only at the beginning ","The user has published a new version of the #pagger in the @figma community, which now allows users to assign tags, prevents the state of the pages from being shared between accounts, and allows users to test it as long as they want (not in the same file).",389,48,1.1428571428571428,-0.019589129835367203

I started using Miro when COVID hit and we started working from home We originally started using it as a simple whiteboard replacement As we became more familiar with the tool we saw its power as more than a whiteboard replacement
Miro is very comprehensive The comprehensiveness leads to frequent software updates It becomes a little irritating that whenever you open the software it prompts you to restart to download the updates","Users appreciate Miro's collaborative capabilities and initially used it as a whiteboard replacement during remote work.

Working fully remotely Miro is my most frequently used software because there is no other tool that lets me collaborate ideate and present information across screens more easily than Miro I cant say that i even miss physical brainstorming boards because i no longer have to transfer handwritten notes to a digital format  it saves so much time and nothing goes missing its really easy to track information and review past discussions because everything is captured digitally all of the tools and templates are very handy i dont have to think to much about how to structure information  its plug and play and theres so much you can do the interface is very intuitive
Miro on ipad pro could be improved to leverage the capabilities of tablets i use miro exclusively on my computer and hardly ever on the ipad because it is very buggy and takes too long to do what i would normally do on a computer writing is fine but its not enough for me to also use miro on my tablet  its a shame but i guess Freeform is a good simple and free alternative it would also be great if Miro could be used in offline mode with an option to sync once online","The user finds Miro extremely helpful for collaborating and presenting information across screens, especially in a remote working environment.
