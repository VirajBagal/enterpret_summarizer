Ecosystem\nMy incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.\nArc needs a mobile/tablet app.\nUser: 8. Mini Arc\nI took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.\nGreat when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.\nUser: 9. Sidebar\nShifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons\na) wide angle screen form factor\nb) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area\nUser: 10. Sidebar\nHowever, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.\nI'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.\nUser: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)\nI expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.\nNot sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!\nUser: 12.

This might change after a few more days.\nI'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.\nUser: 11.
