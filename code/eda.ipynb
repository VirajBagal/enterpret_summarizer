      "I have found Miro to be an incredibly powerful tool for collaborating with teams One of the things I like best about Miro is how easy it is to use The interface is intuitive and userfriendly making it simple to get started even for those who are not particularly techsavvy \n",
      "The realtime collaboration features in Miro are also incredibly helpful Multiple team members can work on a board simultaneously which helps to streamline the collaborative process and ensure that everyone is on the same page Additionally the platforms extensive range of features such as templates sticky notes and diagrams are highly customizable allowing for greater flexibility when working on projects\n",
      "One thing that I have found to be a drawback of Miro is its pricing structure While the platform offers a free plan its more advanced features are only available with paid plans which may be expensive for smaller teams or individuals Additionally the platforms extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users and it may take some time to learn how to use everything effectively However Miros support resources including video tutorials and a user community are quite helpful in getting up to speed quickly\n",

      "After:  This is my 1 choice of tool when collaborating with clients My team uses Miro to document a strategy or wireframe and collect client feedback in realtime it helps ensure the client that we are listening to their wants and needs Instead of using a static PPT where we are just jotting down the notes clients can see the work in action In addition we use the Miro board to document processes and attach key artifacts and URLS This process documentation is exhaustive but Miro allows users to zoom in and out from a micromacro view to learn about the process which is great for leadership to see and great for onboarding It especially works for a global remote company where we can all jump in to review no matter the time zone If you are in the same time zone it works great to get everyone in the room and use as a collaboration tool For example Im located in California and my client is located in the UK We use miro to make updates on our timezone and get very detailed in specific areas of question It allows for transparency review and collaboration\n",
      "In general I like the whiteboarding and mapping capabilities that allow for deep thought process documentation and pure collaboration with teams It allows me to jot my rough thoughts on paper where I then can find patterns and create a more solid process Miro is the perfect think tank environment that you use from start ideation to a finish a solid concept Its also great for inviting colleagues for feedback or collaboration Anyone can use it with a free license\n",
      "Miroboards have a size capacity where if you add too many screenshots it starts to slow down It can also get extremely messy and often confusing for a new user coming in and unsure where to start Sometimes if you start your miroboard too big the details of things like adding arrow connectors can be really tiny Causing me to selecting all and sizing down my space so you can see these details I sometimes run into issues with font formatting if I copied and pasted a highlighted text in bold and then I drag in the text widget it will copy what Ive used when that is not my intention Its really just the small details that I wish were fixed that could make my experience more easier\n",
