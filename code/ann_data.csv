"User: Another problem that Miro solves is the challenge of sharing complex ideas in a simple way. Miro's range of templates, diagrams, and sticky notes make it easy to share ideas visually, which can be especially helpful for projects that require a lot of detail or complexity. This has allowed me to communicate my ideas more effectively with my team members, resulting in better collaboration and a more efficient workflow.
User: I have found Miro to be an incredibly powerful tool for collaborating with teams. One of the things I like best about Miro is how easy it is to use. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it simple to get started even for those who are not particularly tech-savvy. 
The real-time collaboration features in Miro are also incredibly helpful. Multiple team members can work on a board simultaneously, which helps to streamline the collaborative process and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features, such as templates, sticky notes, and diagrams, are highly customizable, allowing for greater flexibility when working on projects.
User: One thing that I have found to be a drawback of Miro is its pricing structure. While the platform offers a free plan, its more advanced features are only available with paid plans, which may be expensive for smaller teams or individuals. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users, and it may take some time to learn how to use everything effectively. However, Miro's support resources, including video tutorials and a user community, are quite helpful in getting up to speed quickly.","User is benefiting from Miro's range of templates, diagrams, and sticky notes which make it easy to share complex ideas visually, resulting in improved collaboration and a more efficient workflow.

"User: **Arc browser continuous review**
Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped

"User: Miro has the power to aggregate what has been shared among multiple tools. In addition, it has the potential to allow multiple people to work at the same time without any problems, and it has been used in seminars and training sessions, and has been very popular. In the training that I participate in, training using miro is increasing, and it is very useful to visualize the result of the discussion in a short time.
User: Miro is easier to use than an actual whiteboard. In particular, it's easy to attach, write, move, and connect sticky notes, and it automatically corrects the connection lines, so you can use it more efficiently than an actual whiteboard. So you can focus on the discussion. Also, miro is great for sharing information you create online, ensuring that the same image information is conveyed. As a comparison to other similar tools, it's nice to have reaction features, icons, and formatting that you can't use up.
User: The disadvantage of miro is that the access can be quite slow depending on the board. When you first open a board with a lot of information on it, you often have to wait a few 10 seconds. I hope that this problem will be solved by devising means such as image processing centered on the area where the display priority is being determined. Also, if you just use it, you don't have a chance to see new or useful functions, so I think it would be good if you were shown it by a pop-up (This feature may already exist and you may have turned it off yourself, but it is true that it does not appear at this time.).","Users find Miro useful for aggregating information from multiple tools and enabling real-time collaboration during seminars and training sessions.

"User: This review is more about Notion itself than the app. After reviewing a bunch of other programs I subscribed to Notion to help build my new businesses internal infrastructure. I was happy at first but it seems that the moment anything goes wrong Notion support is less than helpful. I‚Äôve been going back and forth with Notion support trying to fix some billing issues (updating my payment details). Notion seems fairly incapable of actually troubleshooting the problem and at this point as I keep getting the same suggestions from different ‚Äòpeople‚Äô I‚Äôm convinced Notion help is running on AI and not an actual human with problem solving skills. Despite numerous occasions saying the system won‚Äôt let me update my payment details and suggesting an actual bug that may be causing the issues their reply was: It‚Äôs so easy, you don‚Äôt even have to log in. Please update your information with this link. Also to note, you only get a reply every 24 hours, so after every (it‚Äôs so simple update your info) communication gets a bit tiresome. If you‚Äôve seen Sh*+s creek this whole exchange was the equivalent of ‚Äújust fold in the cheese - what do you mean - it‚Äôs easy, you just fold in the cheese‚Äù.

It‚Äôs at the point where I‚Äôm considering switching to another service which will be a hard decision seeing as we have put a lot of time into building our systems in Notion. Also to note despite being told that the old payment info is incorrect and I cannot update my payment details they continue to attempt to bill the old card number and then send me warnings that I need to update my information.

"User: Collaborating can be challenging while working remotely, but Miro makes it much easier to share ideas, ideate, brainstorm, and create something together. I use it every day to keep track of my tasks and to create conceptual designs before I work in Figma.
User: I like the ease of use with Miro. It's possible to collaborate with colleagues quickly. My favorite feature is the Microsoft Teams integration. With Miro and other whiteboarding tools, we always had issues trying to share editing access on boards, but now that we can embed the boards in Teams, anyone on the call can have access and edit the board, even if they aren't an employee at our company. It honestly has been a game changer for us when we do workshops or user interviews. I also like the single sign on option. It makes getting into Miro much easier and I don't have to enter my password. 
 
I also love that you can take pictures of sticky notes in real life and upload them to Miro and they will turn into Miro stickies. If the handwriting is hard to read, then it might need to be corrected, but this is still a cool feature.
User: There's not much I don't like about Miro. My main frustration is that our company restricts our access and licenses to 30-60 days and deletes our boards after 90 days of inactivity, but I don't think that's a Miro policy, just our company. I do like the fact that you can download a file of the board and reupload it in case any boards get deleted.","Users appreciate Miro for its ease of use and collaboration features, especially the Microsoft Teams integration, which allows seamless sharing and editing access to boards.

There are strict restrictions on IP, and a global proxy+privacy window must be attached to it before it can be used;
There are unstable situations. For example, I went to WeChat to send a message to him halfway through the conversation, and when I came back, I had to refresh the page before I could use it;
There are occasional interruptions in answering, so I need to remind him to continue.

"User: This is my #1 choice of tool when collaborating with clients. My team uses Miro to document a strategy or wireframe and collect client feedback in real-time, it helps ensure the client that we are listening to their wants and needs. Instead of using a static PPT where we are just jotting down the notes, clients can see the work in action. In addition, we use the Miro board to document processes and attach key artifacts and URLS. This process documentation is exhaustive but Miro allows users to zoom in and out from a micro/macro view to learn about the process which is great for leadership to see and great for onboarding. It especially works for a global remote company where we can all jump in to review no matter the time zone. If you are in the same time zone, it works great to get everyone in the room and use as a collaboration tool. For example, I'm located in California and my client is located in the UK. We use miro to make updates on our timezone and get very detailed in specific areas of question. It allows for transparency, review, and collaboration.
User: In general, I like the whiteboarding and mapping capabilities that allow for deep thought, process documentation, and pure collaboration with teams. It allows me to jot my rough thoughts on paper where I then can find patterns and create a more solid process. Miro is the perfect think tank environment that you use from start (ideation) to a finish (a solid concept). It's also great for inviting colleagues for feedback or collaboration. Anyone can use it with a free license.
User: Miroboards have a size capacity where if you add too many screenshots, it starts to slow down. It can also get extremely messy and often confusing for a new user coming in and unsure where to start. Sometimes if you start your miroboard too big, the details of things like adding arrow connectors can be really tiny. Causing me to selecting all and sizing down my space so you can see these details. I sometimes run into issues with font formatting, if I copied and pasted a highlighted text in bold and then I drag in the text widget, it will copy what I've used when that is not my intention. It's really just the small details that I wish were fixed that could make my experience more easier.","Users appreciate Miro as their top choice for collaboration with clients, as it allows real-time feedback, process documentation, and easy onboarding. It is particularly useful for remote teams and different time zones. However, users face issues with size capacity, slow performance with too many screenshots, messy boards, and minor formatting problems.",figma,G2,407,51,0.12530712530712532,0.7359544634819031

It is highly flexible, allowing the user to define the structure and content. I really like the ease of use and the infinite space, which allows you to constantly be adding to existing boards. There are many existing templates that help provide a good starting point for collaboration.
User: One of the challenges that we've seen is integration with other software. I'd like to see a more seamless integration with MS Excel--for instance, the ability to capture live Excel spreadsheets in MIRO that are auto-updates as the underlying Excel sheet changes."," Users find MIRO helpful for managing complex project schedules, product roadmaps, and facilitating collaboration across teams.

I'll also use Miro for other team tasks in which multiple people need to make inputs. 
Its helpful for capturing a large amount of information in a little amount time, and ultimately making sense of those inputs.
User: I describe Miro as an Adobe Illustrator Group Chat. I love the drag and drop flexibility of it and ease of use, which allows me to capture ideas and feedback in real time. Even when I'm working with large groups of people, the tool enables me to synthesize conversations and sharebacks in a way that captures the essence of a meeting.

1. For some reason I am forced to put a password on a board when I make it publically editable. It didn't used to be like this and I find it annoying that I have to do that every time. I end up just saying ""miroboard"" for everything. 
 
2. When I invite outside of my org participants to join a board. Via the UX they often think they have to sign up to view the board, which leads to time lost in the session correcting them and getting them to the board as a guest quickly.

"User: Being able to collaborate with colleagues in a virtual space is fundamental for remote working. It has also made my research activities easier to manage and more accessible within the business. From team building sessions, retrospectives, or working solo - it honestly is a game changer and I can't imagine how we would manage without it.
User: I honestly cannot rate Miro highly enough. It has become an essential part of remote working for me since I was introduced to it in 2020, and one of the most advanced whiteboard tools I have come across. 
 
In my current role as a UX Researcher, I use Miro for facilitating workshops and analysing and synthesising research. I can dedicate an entire board to a research project and give stakeholders a space that they can refer back to at any time. I also embed my project boards in our internal Confluence pages, which allows my colleagues to interact with the board without having to leave the page. 
 
Other features I find useful are: 
- The vast amount of templates available 
- Giving presentations directly from Miro 
- The addition of a private mode 
- 'Show author' on stickies 
- I'm really excited to try the new 'talkback' feature! 
 
It's very intuitive to use so the barrier for entry is extremely low. I often lead workshops with people that aren't very technical and seldom have any issues with people trying to learn how to use Miro's features.
User: Exporting stickies to CSV format with the columns and rows in the correct order can be a bit fiddly. I have to manually separate columns into rows whilst trying to maintain the integrity of the data. Perhaps there could be/is a way to tabulate stickies in bulk within Miro but I haven't found an easy way to do this yet. 
 
I often run out of sticky note colours and would really like to be able to use my own custom colours like you can with frames and shapes. I would love some more themes for diagramming and flow charts, or the ability to save a set of custom colours as a theme for diagramming shapes.","Users find Miro helpful for remote collaboration, particularly in user research and Sprint Retrospectives, as it provides inbuilt templates and acts as a virtual whiteboard. However, some users find it has too many features and difficulty locking frames.",figma,G2,360,38,0.10555555555555556,0.760479211807251

User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd This allows us - in theory - to browse any website.
(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""
Install it. <STRICT_LINK>

The new entry will appear in the list above the button. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL (<STRICT_LINK>, <STRICT_LINK> or <STRICT_LINK> - copy &amp; paste from Browser)
2 ‚úÖ ""open in center"" to open the service like a tab (otherwise it's in the sidebar)
3 ‚úÖ ""Add Ribbon Icon"" to display a side icon. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Specify the icon you want to use.

User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left.
You will have to log in to Google/Apple/Evernote/... the first time. But then it will remember you. (Just like in a browser)
On the top right you find a few buttons, to reload the page. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Summary:

"User: Notion is an absolutely fantastic app for projects, notes, sorting, and many many more due to its versatility and freedom. As a single person, notion is completely free with next to no restrictions. Teams will require payment, but it has a free trial to see how you like it, and I consider it fantastic for groups. However, that being said, mobile notion is severely lacking in certain features that the desktop version has. Basic features like renaming your workspace can only be done on desktop. There are also some bugs with the ui, like the back arrow sometimes just straight up sending me out of the current workspace, and the toolbar disappearing and requiring me to restart the app.
These don‚Äôt ruin the app by any means, as notion is still an amazing app and is still amazing in mobile, but I would consider mobile notion a great ADDITION to your desktop notion. Use desktop as your main form of using notion when creating, and use mobile when you‚Äôre away from the desktop or need to check something. Mobile as your only form of using notion isn‚Äôt terrible, but it‚Äôs definitely inferior.
Notion overall is an amazing app with amazing developers, who deserve lots of love and support. They also gave major generosity with the app, of which many other services would‚Äôve charged the individual a large amount of money to use what notion gives for free, which again is pretty much everything except very minor things like upload file size limits.","User praises Notion for its versatility and freedom, but notes that mobile version lacks certain features and has bugs.

"User: The ability to quickly collaborate on user flows and audit our product with non-designers has been made super quick with the use of FigJam.

User: Currently, while components are available within FigJam, there isn't an easy way to visibly pull in the components without copying them over from a design file.

"User: People often ask me for good examples of executive communication: let's talk about @joshm, the CEO of @browsercompany. ‚Üì
(And the intelligent and underrated use of YouTube for a business) <STRICT_LINK>
User: Its particularity? He chose as a social network to express himself... YouTube. Uncommon.
Concretely, @browsercompany has a channel with 20k subscribers and 2 types of videos:
- the culture and vision of the company
- tutorials and advice for its users
<STRICT_LINK> <STRICT_LINK>
User: We will mainly focus on the first category, the one in which @joshm is personally involved.
In terms of form, these videos are YouTube-friendly, that is to say:
- exclusive (no balanced body videos on all channels)
- 10-20 minutes
- with a chapter
User: There are 2 formats that I particularly like:
1) its Q&A in early 2023 to report and answer, for example, the question of its business model... with embedded graphs and dataviz. 72k views, 3rd channel video.
<STRICT_LINK> <STRICT_LINK>
User: What is interesting is that this video starts from a tweet that he posted in early December, just before the 2nd meeting of the @browsercompany board... with the desire to be transparent and accountable to his users (‚Äúbuild in public‚Äù).
<STRICT_LINK>
User: And, hey presto, 2 weeks later, he answers it in this famous video:
<STRICT_LINK>
User: 2) A video where he films himself in a photo booth from his Mac desktop... which allows him to browse his Finder and show content (images, sounds, videos, etc.) by unfolding his story. Funny, with a touch of brothel/artisan.
<STRICT_LINK> <STRICT_LINK>
User: This format was called ‚Äúvideofile_‚Äù and allows @browsercompany to ‚Äútell‚Äù its new features and the ‚Äúphilosophy behind‚Äù, each time being embodied by an employee (not just the CEO). And given the engagement rates, that's interesting. <STRICT_LINK>
User: 2 other videos that were a hit: - a ‚Äúmeta-video‚Äù where the CEO watches and reacts to a review of his browser by one of the biggest tech influencers, MKBHD. It's THE most popular video with 343K views. Skilled at surfing on his visibility.

"User: Everyone: ""Use @googledocs it's simple ‚Äì No use @evernote and @NotionHQ it's shared ‚Äì No do @RoamResearch it's serious ‚Äì No, use Apple Notes and Google Keep...""

User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd Obsidian is built on a technology called ""Electron"".
Electron is just a Chrome browser, that runs like an app on your desktop.
So essentially Obsidian = Snazzy Browser for your notes.
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd This allows us - in theory - to browse any website.
(In practice it works 80% of the time, hence I couldn't get it to work with @tana_inc or @logseq )
While Obsidian does not support that out of the box - with a plugin it's easy. Let's get to it!
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Go to Settings &gt; Community Plugins. Search for ""Custom Frames""
Install it. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq In the Obsidian settings there will be now a new entry ""Custom Frames"" (towards end of your list)
Find the ""New Frame"" button and click it. A Frame is such a browser window, that we can use to access all of the services.
The new entry will appear in the list above the button. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Configure your Frame
1 Set the URL (<STRICT_LINK>, <STRICT_LINK> or <STRICT_LINK> - copy &amp; paste from Browser)
2 ‚úÖ ""open in center"" to open the service like a tab (otherwise it's in the sidebar)
3 ‚úÖ ""Add Ribbon Icon"" to display a side icon. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Specify the icon you want to use.
Go to <STRICT_LINK> and find an icon you like.
Copy paste it's name into the ""icon"" textfield in previous step. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq RESTART OBSIDIAN
Your new ribbon icon should now appear on the left.
You will have to log in to Google/Apple/Evernote/... the first time. But then it will remember you. (Just like in a browser)
On the top right you find a few buttons, to reload the page. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @googledocs @evernote @NotionHQ @RoamResearch @obsdmd @tana_inc @logseq Summary:
‚ñ∫ Download ""Custom Frames"" plugin
‚ñ∫ Add frames to any website, as Obsidian is technically a browser.
‚ñ∫ This technique works with ANY website. So you can integrate google calendar, facebook or a todo app into obsidian!

"User: Hi all, I am working on a Figma plugin that needs to import style from our team library. Through research I think the way is to first use Figma REST API to get the keys of styles from our library file, and the use figma.importStyleByKeyAsync() to import the style. However, the issue is, this requires me to put my Access token in the plugin, and I don‚Äôt want to. Is there a way for plugin to authenticate when making REST API calls on behalf of the person who uses the plugin?
Or are there any other easier ways to import/access styles from team library file in plugin? Thanks a lot!!!
User: You have several ways:
Users will create their own personal access tokens, which will be inserted into the input field of your plugin.
Users will open the necessary library files, run the plugin there to get the necessary keys, return to another file to continue working.
Hardcode the keys in the plugin.
3.1. Or add these keys to, for example, a JSON file that you or anyone else can keep updating as needed.

"User: I‚Äôm wondering if we are close enough to see a drastic shift in design tools moving away from the top bar, sidebar, canvas, sidebar model. There‚Äôre examples in this direction, eg Play, but that‚Äôs like the other extreme. Probably the sweet spot is in the somewhere in the middle.
User: Hierarchy and organisation can maintain their association with the tree model but parts of the props can move to each and every pixel in the canvas?
User: Another way to get inspired and think about this is looking at builders, people who physically build stuff like roads, gardens, houses, electrical installations etc. There are certain patterns emerging like specialized tools, big or small hacks when lacking the tools‚Ä¶
User: They carry a bunch of general tools with them, have extra tools nearby and focus on speed or/and quality. When in multiplayer mode, each person has a specialized position or supports the main builder with orchestrated moves. Their canvas is always messy to the eye.
User: I think a way for @figma to speed up Workflows, especially as they want to onboard new users globally, would be shortcuts for plugins and a clean up and redesign of all the helpful stuff added everywhere the last year. Same idea for other design tools."," The user suggests that design tools like Figma could benefit from a shift away from the traditional top bar, sidebar, and canvas model.

"User: 10 tools I use every week as a product manager:
User: 1. @asana 
This is our tool of choice when it comes to organizing work throughout the company.
Simple but powerful, it does everything we need to keep our teams organized and our work visible.
User: 2. @MiroHQ 
I've been using Miro for everything lately: product briefs, data analyses, brainstorming, mockups. 
It's a tool that can do a ton of things well, and helps make visuals much easier to consume vs. a document.
User: 3. Looker
We've used Looker for several years, and it's our go-to spot for building reports and dashboards.
Our core team dashboard and pricing/conversion dashboards both live here, and I check each daily.
User: 4. @Amplitude_HQ 
For product analytics, we use Amplitude. Looker gives me high-level business metrics; Amplitude gives me the details.
We use this for understanding the user behavior behind the metrics.
User: 5. @CrazyEgg &amp; @hotjar 
Two tools that do similar things: we use one for our website and one for our app.
These give us even more qualitative data behind our metrics, with things like heat maps and screen recordings.
User: 6. @SlackHQ 
I barely use email any more, and while the Slack overload is real, it does enable fast async communication among our teams, wherever we are.
It's also great for consolidating notifications from other tools (Asana, Google Docs, etc.) if you set up the integrations.
User: 7. @Officevibe 
Our HR team implemented this tool, and as PM, it gives me a bunch of metrics about how my team is doing.
It gives me some data backing for how the team is feeling, and shows me when I might need to spend time on morale.
User: 8. @figma 
Miro is great for lo-fi prototypes and brainstorming, but at some point it moves to Figma.
This is where we build prototypes for user testing, comment on designs, and ultimately deliver the final spec to developers.","The user works a 9-5 job and runs a freelance design business, using various tools to stay organized.

"User: Hi there, I am currently laying the foundations for a Design Language System. At the same time another team is working on the first of a series of Apps. My intention is to take the components that they create for that first app and then add them to the design system, so we can re-use elements for all the future Apps
The DLS and the the first App will be created as two separate design files within the same project. My hope was that at various intervals I would be able to copy and paste content from the App into the DLS then publish the library from the DLS and get the other team to use the library swap feature to swap their local components with those from the DLS published library.
But my initial tests lead me to believe that this isn‚Äôt possible. It seems that you can only use library swap on two externally published libraries rather than an external library (the DLS) and a local library (the App). Is this the case?
If so, what is the suggested workflow in this situation?
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks

Some of our multinational stakeholders, whom we cannot insist to install or start an account for Figma or anything else, as they rely on pdf documents for design review or sharing with internal team.

image2966√ó1878 323 KB
image3896√ó1958 419 KB
When giving ‚Äúpadding‚Äù on Figma auto-layout to a button, the text position (inside the box, not the box) is not in the centre height. In the following example, you can see that in one font type there is 2 px space at the bottom and 1 at the top and in the other one, 2px at the top and 1 at the bottom.
That‚Äôs led to; 1, the text is not in the centre height, 2, the padding is getting extra which then lead to the wrong implementation.
Later on CSS, the text div won‚Äôt behave like that and will wrap right around the text.
The ideal is that the space (padding) above and below the text is even and exactly as set in the padding.
Is anyone have a solution for this challenge?
User: I am having the exact same issue (to the point that I thought I wrote this post ) We are trying to define fonts, text box behavior, and auto-layout for a design system, so this is a serious problem.

It'd also be really helpful, for the facilitation of workshop activities, to be able to show and hide sections. this would ideally be on a user or for users or user groups.

"User: I would otherwise be doing the same in Figma, but Miro is quicker allowing me to type in the shapes and connect arrows and lines to shapes.

User: I like that you can easily plot out ideas through notes or shapes with the handy arrows/lines that connect them together. I also like to use templates, as then I don't need to create new templates or copy them from other miro boards.
User: I find grouping objects and selecting objects within the group a bit cumbersom.

"User: Miro solves several problems for product managers, including collaboration, ideation and brainstorming, project management, prototyping, and remote work. It provides a centralized platform for product managers to collaborate with their team members and stakeholders, regardless of their location.

It also helps product managers manage their projects effectively, create and manage product roadmaps, user story maps, and agile and Scrum methodologies.

"User: We want to start using versioning in our projects and we are trying to figure out the best way to do it.
The approach that makes more sense to us is to create a new branch on each file for the new version.
Our issue is that we have team members working on each version (1 and 2) but we can‚Äôt create a new feature branch for the version 2 branch (we don‚Äôt have this issue for version 1 because that is the main branch).
Our question is if does exist an official way to work with different versions in the same file in order to handle versioning or if there is a better way to do this.
Example of what we need
Button v1 branch (main)
a new feature for Button v1 (a new branch from the main branch)
Button v2 branch (version 2 branch)
a new feature for Button v2 (a new branch from version 2 branch)
The second question is how to handle major, minor, and patch updates into Figma (following semantic versioning definition)
Our idea is to handle major changes with branches, and minor/patches with version history. What do you think?

"User: Intro
There is an interesting concept in Figma that‚Äôs used and was presented by multiple people and has different names: Placeholder, Slots, Dummies, Layout Blocks, and so on:
‚ùñ Placeholder component is the base one.
‚óá Placeholder instances may be nested into another ‚ùñ Component.
‚óá Placeholder instances nested into ‚óá Component instances may be swapped with any other component instances‚Ä¶
More details in this video by @Adam_Ruthendorf-Przewoski.
The next step of its evolution is Layout Blocks by @Mr.Biscuit.
An issue
I have a base ‚ùñ Placeholder component:
‚óá Placeholder instances may be nested into other components (‚ùñ Column here):
image2080√ó384 8.54 KB
What I need is to nest a ‚óá Column instance into another ‚óá Column instance by swapping one of the ‚óá Placeholders.
This is needed to customize Auto Layout spacings and other properties:
image804√ó564 8.43 KB
But when I try to do this I see an error message Failed to set component: cycle detected!:
I totally understand why we‚Äôre not allowed to nest instances into their Main components ‚Äî it will create an endless cycle such as infinite screen share:
image1600√ó808 102 KB
But actually, it is not endless ‚Äî we always will have the last one ‚óá Placeholder instance as a stop point:
image804√ó932 11.4 KB
My Demo file to better understand what‚Äôs going on.
Possible solutions
There are a couple of solutions that solve this issue but still are not optimal:
Have multiple absolutely identical components to nest one into another.
image1568√ó1242 22.3 KB
For the upper-level use a component with more placeholders inside and hide unnecessary ones.
image1092√ó644 12.3 KB

User: I think the only solution for now is to create a ‚ùñ Main Container component with ‚óá slot instances inside. Then you need to create also another component for ‚ùñ Column/Row with variants.

"User: I‚Äôve been a designer for a little over 13 years. Early in my design career, I started feeling like I wanted a more ‚Äòtechnical role‚Äô and switched to front-end development.
I remember the exact moment that the concept of components and systems thinking clicked for meüí°
User: At the time, I was building custom WordPress themes. 
Within my theme, I'd have a partials folder, full of my silly little components.
And I had my templates folder, full of my silly little templates.
User: Pulling components from my partials folder into my templates enabled me to have really modular, maintainable and organised template files.
Seeing it all come together was a huge a-ha moment for me, but I didn't know why ‚Äì¬†at the time, design systems wasn't a well-known concept.
User: I spent a tonne of time playing with Sass, extending classes, using mixins, and all that fun, CSS goodness.
‚úΩ
Looking back at it now, I realise that what I was really (kind of) doing, was implementing a simplified version of component properties.
User: Code felt natural and intuitive ‚Äì I loved the idea of having a bunch of components that I could pull from and iterate upon rapidly.
I wanted to be able to replicate that workflow in design so badly. But design tooling wasn't anywhere close to what it is now.
User: Designing in Photoshop involved a tonne of manual copying, pasting and replacing... The process felt outdated and ineffective, and often resulted in a tonne of inconsistencies.
I dreamed of a tool that could reflect some of what we do in code... even the tiniest bit.
User: When I learned about Figma a few years later, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted, and my passion for design exploded.
I'm so grateful to be working at a time where technology is evolving so rapidly, and some of the gaps between design/dev are starting to thin out.
User: This was a lot of tweets about nothing, but I woke up feeling so in love with my career. 
And just generally grateful that I get to sit around all day, working on design systems, architecting components, crafting design patterns and collaborating with developers. üòçü•∞ü•π

"User: Hi,
Today during UI class I have discovered an annyoing behavior. I tried to create a simple product card with a picture and a ‚ÄúSpecial offer‚Äù label placed inside the picture.
In order to reproduce the issue:
Step 1: Create a text field, turn it into Auto Layout and give it a fill color, just to create a label basically, like ‚ÄúFLASH SALE‚Äù etc‚Ä¶
Step 2: Add a rectangle and fill it with an image.
Step 3: Turn both into an Auto-Layout frame and try to adjust the label and the image so that the label sits inside. While doing so, you shall discover that the image covers the label and hides it, even when the label layer is above the image.
Despite that, when merging a text and an image into Auto-Layout and only then turning the text to Auto-Layout as well to give if a fill color - this method works perfectly fine, but at last both methods shall lead to the same result as far as I am concerned, so there might be a bug here. Or is it?
Thanks.","User encountered an issue in Figma where an image covers a ""Special Offer"" label when both are turned into an Auto-Layout frame, even if the label layer is above the image.

User: @abhayance @arcinternet I don't want to mirror spaces. Earlier, spaces were persistent across profiles. So the whole point of separating ""personal"" &amp; ""work"" through profiles was moot. I hope spaces act as projects within personal and work contexts.","

"User: I‚Äôve been looking for an app with the kind of capabilities notion has for sometime, but was hesitant to download because of all the reviews relating to its poor performance on the iPad (which is where I do most of my work), but eventually decided to give it a go since most of the reviews I saw were at least a year old and I figured they might have sorted out the bugs in it by now.
They have not. I‚Äôm writing this, not 20 minutes after initially downloading and testing it out and it‚Äôs already very clear to me that it simply doesn‚Äôt work. This is only a matter of the interface (which I would say is not super intuitive anyway) - I could have overlooked that, assuming I would get used to it with time - the very basics were not functional. It‚Äôs a battle to do even the simplest actions; scrolling down the page, selecting a template, deleting and creating pages - all the things you rely on regardless of whether the interface is to your liking. Was very willing to give this a good try before I disregarded it, but I don‚Äôt even see how that would be possible without risking all of my uni work/notes. Definitely needs a rethink, which is a shame because, according to the reviews, it works so well on laptop/PC and is obviously very effective. But this app is not conducive to working on an iPad, which effectively renders the point of having a tool that‚Äôs supposed to keep everything in one, easily accessible place moot, because, if you use a tablet (even if it‚Äôs not your main device) you simply can‚Äôt use it on there and so would either not be able to use your iPad anytime you wanted to make a note, or would have to have two separate systems.

"User: Figma is used for both our greyframes (medium-fidelity layout documents) as well as our final designs. It's collaboration tools are second to none and clients love getting the up-close look at their products. This really feels like a tool by web developers for web developers, though I will admit that the recent acquisition by Adobe makes me pretty nervous.
User: Figma is an excellent tool that forces a full paradigm shift for us designers. With auto-layout, objects on the page flow freely down the page, just like on the web. It's a 99% complete implementation of flexbox in a design program.

The only way to programmatically get the real path commands for a PATH type object is to go through the image rest api, retrieve the svg and parse it to get the d attribute.
User: The only way I know how to achieve this image is to outline a stroke, which turns it into a shape, then apply a stroke to that shape.
If that is what you are doing, the information represented by your purple line no longer exists for the node. That loss happens when you outline the stroke and all the information we have to provide is the dashed line stroke geometry.

Using <STRICT_LINK> as a perfect example (created by @cnnr_cllhn) <STRICT_LINK>
User: @cnnr_cllhn LoseTheVery is a fantastic tool that finds a more ‚Äûconcise‚Äù adjective without using ‚Äûvery‚Äù. Example: very rich = affluent.
The core idea is simple and the UI was chosen to reflect that .It's straight to the point (just like the Google Search homepage). So what's the problem? <STRICT_LINK>
User: @cnnr_cllhn ‚ùå There are 3 main flaws:
1. Site feels messy
2. Design lacks consistency
3. Elements feel a little too cramped

üë©üé® Let's work on that that using @figma
User: @cnnr_cllhn @figma 1Ô∏è‚É£: Decluttering üßπ

User: @cnnr_cllhn @figma 2Ô∏è‚É£: Let the design breathe üí®

Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below üßµ (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different üòç
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (‚åò+T).
Saying that, ‚åò+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ‚åò+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (üíö to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)

"User: I can analyse data in visual form really quickly on Miro - it really helps connect the dots when you can see all of the information in one space. it is also really helpful as a collaborative tool - i no longer have to be the single scribe, everyone can contribute actively during brainstorming and it really helps with getting open feedback from stakeholders which is not often easy to do verbally. i don't think i could be without miro especially in a remote working environment.
User: Working fully remotely, Miro is my most frequently used software because there is no other tool that lets me collaborate, ideate and present information across screens more easily than Miro. I can't say that i even miss physical brainstorming boards because i no longer have to transfer handwritten notes to a digital format - it saves so much time and nothing goes missing. it's really easy to track information and review past discussions because everything is captured digitally. all of the tools and templates are very handy, i don't have to think to much about how to structure information - it's plug and play and there's so much you can do. the interface is very intuitive.
User: Miro on ipad pro could be improved to leverage the capabilities of tablets. i use miro exclusively on my computer and hardly ever on the ipad because it is very buggy and takes too long to do what i would normally do on a computer. writing is fine but it's not enough for me to also use miro on my tablet - it's a shame but i guess Freeform is a good simple and free alternative. it would also be great if Miro could be used in offline mode with an option to sync once online.","Users appreciate Miro's simplicity, templates, real-time collaboration, and ample workspace for brainstorming and problem-solving.

I recently obtained my certification from your platform, and while I appreciate the knowledge and skills I gained from the experience, I believe it's time for a change in your testing methods.
User: @NotionHQ We're in 2023, and your current question-and-answer format feels outdated. With the vast resources available to us online, including Google, Notion docs, and ChatGPT, it's unnecessary to rely solely on memorization and rote learning.

I‚Äôm having a hard time with something that should be very basic. I have 25 or so screens, the ONLY interaction between them is that the user should be able to click and/or press the arrow key to navigate LINEARLY between them.

"User: Helps to visually explain complex systems in a simple way. Provides value to our consultancy.
User: FigJam's simplicity and ease of use enables fast mapping and sharing of complex systems and dependencies. I've recently created several sprawling figjam charts that outline marketing programs from beginning to end for our clients. They have been so helpful keeping the team informed at a high level and are a great reference to regularly huddle around. 
 
This is just one kind of use - because of its flexibility you can begin to discover ways to think and present ideas large or small. Create fast design mock-ups, review and provide feedback on designs, create storyboards - the list can go on and on. Easily shareable to anyone with little to no trouble with login attempts or dealing with incompatible file types. 
 
It feels so freeing to break from the clunky confines of a ppt slide with its bad clip art and boring bullet points. Expanding across an endless canvas allows us to combat any confusion or anxiety that tends to show up around building complex marketing campaigns.

I wish you could designate that connecting lines don't intersect, and if you have to pull a point to make the connecting lines not intersect, they smooth out so the line doesn't look so jagged.

"User: Notion itself is powerful, but the app must get a low score! However, all functions cannot be operated on the app. For example, basic operations such as moving positions of some objects on the app are not possible! The interface usually gets stuck and is difficult to operate, and the compatibility is poor. If you don't want to do a more complete edit on the app, you'll die! Very poor experience of use! It's best to use it on a computer!
Also, sharing content from another place to Notion is very difficult to use. After sharing, you have to go back to Notion to do a bunch of operations and organization.

"User: Hi!
Turning off ‚Äúsnap to pixel grid‚Äù in a Figma Design file no longer changes snapping behavior when dragging frames around.
Whether this feature is turned on or off, a dragged frame still snaps to each pixel, no matter how zoomed-in. Note that some other objects (e.g., vector objects) still respect this setting. It‚Äôs just an issue with frames, components, and component instances. Note that If I group the frame, I then can drag the group to any sub-pixel location.
I‚Äôve restarted my machine, restarted Figma, checked for updates, reloaded tabs, tried it in other design files. Tried it in the client, in Chrome, and in Safari. Same problem.
Can anyone else replicate this?

"User: Hi, I have an using when using the Figma.
When I disable the Chrome Hardware acceleration, I am able to open the Figma without any issue, albeit slower.
But when I enable the chrome hardware acceleration setting, everytime I open Figma, my browser will flicker once, and says that my browser did not support WEBGL.
Is there anyway to fix it?
I need to enable the hardware acceleration for other chrome features. But then I won‚Äôt be able to use Figma if I do so.
User: Hi @Tsasqa_Galih ,
Is this happening on a specific file or all the files?
If this is happening on a specific file, then it might be possible the file has reached its memory limits.
Figma is a browser-based app, which means it‚Äôs subjected to a 2GB available memory limit that applies to each browser tab, including those in our Desktop App. When loading or editing Figma files nears or exceeds this memory limit, it can cause performance issues like long load times or crashes.
I recommend you to:
Reduce the size of the file will usually help with load speed
Reduce the size of individual pages (for example by splitting a page into multiple pages) will usually help with rendering performance.
Hidden layers: loading and then hiding a large number of layers, especially in components or with images stored in them, can cause a high use of available memory on loading.
Stacked Masks and Effects like shadows and blurs also take a lot of memory to load.
You can find more tips in our Help Center article on how to Reduce memory usage in files that will help you to avoid hitting this limit again.
If you are still running into issues despite these workflows, you can reach out our support team so they can take a deeper a look into your issues here. Hope it helps!
User: Hi @Celine_Doan

"User: This app worked fine as a free user, however after becoming a subscribed member, I ran into some annoying and suspicious issues. I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes. Of course, there‚Äôs a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer. I paid $4.99 for the one month subscription, but it won‚Äôt actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe, but I already have. The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay.
My app says I am a subscribed member, so why is it denying me member benefits? I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone, restarting the app, deleting and downloading the app again, logging out and then back in etc. Nothing has worked so far. Not only do I feel robbed, but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription, I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses, but after subscribing, it sends me straight to the subscription choice page. That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it, regardless of if that is actually the case or not. Looking through some of the other lower reviews, I am not the only one who has ran into this problem. Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for.
Summary: I paid for premium, but the app isn‚Äôt letting me actually use premium benefits.

"User: I love the new feature that allows multiple prototypes per page. One issue I‚Äôm having with it, is it assumes I want everything to be a new flow starting point each time I don‚Äôt link something from the first flow starting page.
It has a very linear mindset. When I work/prototype I tend to work on a section, then link it back and that creates many flow starting points on accident and I have to delete them.
It‚Äôd be nice if either - it only created the first one, and doesn‚Äôt assume you want many or there‚Äôs some kinda preference/setting where I can turn it off.
Do other people delete starting points or have work arounds? Or is there a preference/setting I‚Äôm missing where I can turn it off?

"User: This app worked fine as a free user, however after becoming a subscribed member, I ran into some annoying and suspicious issues. I wanted to utilize the AI to see where the limits were and then to eventually use it for academic and creative purposes. Of course, there‚Äôs a limit to free uses so I subscribed to a month to see how often I would have to use this and if it was really worth paying for longer. I paid $4.99 for the one month subscription, but it won‚Äôt actually let me use the AI and instead tells me that I need to subscribe, but I already have. The receipt is in my email as proof that I did pay. My app says I am a subscribed member, so why is it denying me member benefits? I have tried many things to fix this including restarting my phone, restarting the app, deleting and downloading the app again, logging out and then back in etc. Nothing has worked so far. Not only do I feel robbed, but it almost feels intentional because when I tried to use the AI before paying for a subscription, I would only get a message saying that I have run out of free uses, but after subscribing, it sends me straight to the subscription choice page. That gives the impression that the app is purposely not letting me use the AI program even though I have paid for it, regardless of if that is actually the case or not. Looking through some of the other lower reviews, I am not the only one who has ran into this problem. Please fix this because it is frustrating to not be able to use what I paid for.

However, the issue is, this requires me to put my Access token in the plugin, and I don‚Äôt want to.

Or are there any other easier ways to import/access styles from team library file in plugin? Thanks a lot!!!

Users will create their own personal access tokens, which will be inserted into the input field of your plugin.

"User: üöÄ How to turn an ‚Äûalmost perfect‚Äù UI/UX to ‚Äûperfect‚Äù.
Using <STRICT_LINK> as a perfect example (created by @cnnr_cllhn) <STRICT_LINK>
User: @cnnr_cllhn LoseTheVery is a fantastic tool that finds a more ‚Äûconcise‚Äù adjective without using ‚Äûvery‚Äù. Example: very rich = affluent.
The core idea is simple and the UI was chosen to reflect that .It's straight to the point (just like the Google Search homepage). So what's the problem? <STRICT_LINK>
User: @cnnr_cllhn ‚ùå There are 3 main flaws:
1. Site feels messy
2. Design lacks consistency
3. Elements feel a little too cramped
We'll approach it ‚Äûvia negativa‚Äù style: by removing stuff rather than adding.
üë©üé® Let's work on that that using @figma
User: @cnnr_cllhn @figma 1Ô∏è‚É£: Decluttering üßπ
The most important step would be to remove the clutter ‚Äì the annoying newsletter popup, the newsletter section and the newsletter banner. We'll get back to it later.
This has already made a difference. The interface looks significantly cleaner. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @cnnr_cllhn @figma 2Ô∏è‚É£: Let the design breathe üí®
Let's add more whitespace ‚Äì the more the better. This will achieve a better visual separation.
Now the `very + x = y` line instantly grabs our attention. <STRICT_LINK>
User: @cnnr_cllhn @figma 3Ô∏è‚É£: Making buttons prettier üíÑ
Buttons look chaotic here: randomly spaced, different padding, etc.
Let's increase the font size, adjust the padding and replace the word ‚Äûrandom‚Äù with a dice icon. We'll also ‚Äûinvert‚Äù the third button.
The buttons now look modern and consistent. <STRICT_LINK>","A user discussed how to improve the UI/UX of a website called LoseTheVery, which helps find concise adjectives. They identified three main flaws: messiness, inconsistency in design, and cramped elements. Using Figma, they suggested decluttering by removing unnecessary newsletter elements, adding more whitespace for better visual separation, improving button design for consistency, and simplifying typography by using only two typefaces.",figma,Twitter,246,60,0.24390243902439024,0.6480127573013306
