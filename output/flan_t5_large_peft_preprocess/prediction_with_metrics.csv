Miro is easier to use than an actual whiteboard In particular its easy to attach write move and connect sticky notes and it automatically corrects the connection lines so you can use it more efficiently than an actual whiteboard So you can focus on the discussion Also miro is great for sharing information you create online ensuring that the same image information is conveyed As a comparison to other similar tools its nice to have reaction features icons and formatting that you cant use up
The disadvantage of miro is that the access can be quite slow depending on the board When you first open a board with a lot of information on it you often have to wait a few 10 seconds I hope that this problem will be solved by devising means such as image processing centered on the area where the display priority is being determined Also if you just use it you dont have a chance to see new or useful functions so I think it would be good if you were shown it by a popup This feature may already exist and you may have turned it off yourself but it is true that it does not appear at this time","The user appreciates Figma for its ease of use in remote and hybrid teams, allowing for asynchronous problem-solving and accessible designs.

Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in

Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space

Its also great for consolidating notifications from other tools Asana Google Docs etc if you set up the integrations

Notion,Twitter,"Arc browser continuous review
Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space
Eg my Slack always open links in my work spaceprofile
Im logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces

I have found Miro to be an incredibly powerful tool for collaborating with teams One of the things I like best about Miro is how easy it is to use The interface is intuitive and userfriendly making it simple to get started even for those who are not particularly techsavvy 
The realtime collaboration features in Miro are also incredibly helpful Multiple team members can work on a board simultaneously which helps to streamline the collaborative process and ensure that everyone is on the same page Additionally the platforms extensive range of features such as templates sticky notes and diagrams are highly customizable allowing for greater flexibility when working on projects
One thing that I have found to be a drawback of Miro is its pricing structure While the platform offers a free plan its more advanced features are only available with paid plans which may be expensive for smaller teams or individuals Additionally the platforms extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users and it may take some time to learn how to use everything effectively However Miros support resources including video tutorials and a user community are quite helpful in getting up to speed quickly",The user loves FigJam for its ease of use and prefers it over multiple apps for conceptualizing ideas and storyboards.

Notion,Twitter,"Arc browser continuous review
Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space
Eg my Slack always open links in my work spaceprofile

figma,Twitter,"We want to start using versioning in our projects and we are trying to figure out the best way to do it
The approach that makes more sense to us is to create a new branch on each file for the new version
Our issue is that we have team members working on each version 1 and 2 but we cant create a new feature branch for the version 2 branch we dont have this issue for version 1 because that is the main branch
Our question is if does exist an official way to work with different versions in the same file in order to handle versioning or if there is a better way to do this
Example of what we need
Button v1 branch main
a new feature for Button v1 a new branch from the main branch
Button v2 branch version 2 branch
a new feature for Button v2 a new branch from version 2 branch
The second question is how to handle major minor and patch updates into Figma following semantic versioning definition

Notion,Twitter,"Arc browser continuous review
Tldr Im loving it So far its been a fantastic experience Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped
What is Arc Check out browsercompany 
Dive into the thread below  1n
1 Firsttime use experience
Really well done I enjoyed the semiinteractive introlearning experience The keyboard shortcuts were introduced too
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent Straight away you know these guys are trying to do something different 
2 Firsttime use contd
I wish there was a bit more practice your shortcuts the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere T
Saying that T execution is excellent and can be used for commands very much like K in other apps
3 Split view
This is my 1 feature so far
It seems to me that the people at browsercompany invested in getting to know users
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023 What customer problems are there left to solve
And still
4 Split view contd
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows  to you BetterSnapTool etc Its chaos
Time will tell if Split view solves this but right now Im thrilled
5 Split view contd
The microinteractions here feel just right Intuitive discoverable The onboarding helped too
6 Profiles
This is a big one for me I struggled with this on Chrome My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use
But obviously that doesnt work well
7 Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone
Arc needs a mobiletablet app
8 Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab But if I need to stay longer in the context I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc
9 Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart This suits me for a few reasons
a wide angle screen form factor
b utility of vertical space is better for Spaces history etc all coexisting in one area
10 Sidebar
However my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird This might change after a few more days
Id love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS depending on when I place Arc on my monitor
11 Ecosystem contd
I expected browsing on Arc wont be seamless across devices wout native iOS apps Turns out the iPadOSMacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account
Not sure about the predictability of this but so far looks good
12 Living with Arc
 cant imagine giving up Spaces
 pinned foldersbookmarks as expected
 keep forgetting to use Favourites
 have a lovehate relationship w links opening in overlay
browsercompany I really want to change icons on pinned folders pretty please
13 The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant Cant wait to dive in 

Hey browsercompany I need your help
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space
Eg my Slack always open links in my work spaceprofile
Im logged into two different Google accounts across two spaces
JiriJerabek browsercompany Great question Not right now but this feature for link routing by Space is coming in a couple weeks

The DLS and the the first App will be created as two separate design files within the same project My hope was that at various intervals I would be able to copy and paste content from the App into the DLS then publish the library from the DLS and get the other team to use the library swap feature to swap their local components with those from the DLS published library
But my initial tests lead me to believe that this isnt possible It seems that you can only use library swap on two externally published libraries rather than an external library the DLS and a local library the App Is this the case

Step 1
Create a new artboard and add a rectangle with a grey fill 
Step 2 
Go into vector edit mode and select 2 anchor points Manipulate those till you get an angle you like 
Step 3 
Repeat the first 2 steps and make sure to connect each begin of a fold with the end points of the previous one 
Step 4
Finish your composition make sure to create artboard copies for different iterations 
Step 5 
Time for some color Create a linear gradient going from light to dark and copy amp paste the style to your vectors OPTCMDC gt OPTCMDV 
Tip Use more than 2 color stops in your gradient for a unique look 
Step 6 
Nice Now we just have to change the gradient angles for every other vector to create more realistic lighting 
Step 7 
To take your gradient fold to the next level introduce some extra color combinations 
Bonus Step 
You can try to go for a top and bottom gradient effect as shown below 
Okay one more bonus step 
You can even try to split up a larger gradient in multiple stops to create an effect like shown below
