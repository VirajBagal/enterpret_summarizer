Notion,Appstore/Playstore,"User: I'm not a big planner to begin with, probably due to my lack of enjoyment for more mainstream planners like Google calendar and traditional paper planners. Google (while claiming to be user-friendly) had too many tools and GUI's to navigate through which felt overwhelming to me, while still lacking the flexibility I desired. Paper planners I encountered in the store didn't do the job either because they were not formatted exactly how I wanted, and of course a regular old notebook didn't provide the online accessibility I wanted.
Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality. It provided helpful templates I could use to give an overall format for what I wanted to write (checklists, boxes, etc.) which were incredibly customizable. The tool is simple yet powerful, without any unnecessary visual effects or special features you are forced to learn.

So you can focus on the discussion. Also, miro is great for sharing information you create online, ensuring that the same image information is conveyed. As a comparison to other similar tools, it's nice to have reaction features, icons, and formatting that you can't use up.
User: The disadvantage of miro is that the access can be quite slow depending on the board. When you first open a board with a lot of information on it, you often have to wait a few 10 seconds. I hope that this problem will be solved by devising means such as image processing centered on the area where the display priority is being determined. Also, if you just use it, you don't have a chance to see new or useful functions, so I think it would be good if you were shown it by a pop-up (This feature may already exist and you may have turned it off yourself, but it is true that it does not appear at this time.).","The user appreciates Figma for its ease of use in remote and hybrid teams, allowing for asynchronous problem-solving and accessible designs.

Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below 🧵 (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different 😍
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (⌘+T).
Saying that, ⌘+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ⌘+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (💚 to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!

Notion,Twitter,"User: Think it's impossible to create a successful solo business without coding and an audience? Think again! I did it, and here's how I did it to earn my first dollars here (🎁 a gift is waiting for you in the last tweet): <STRICT_LINK>
User: Before we begin:
When I won +$2500 here.
- I had an audience of 500 followers
- I didn't know how to code
- I didn't know anything about Twitter
I did.
So did you.
Now here's how I did it 👇
User: 💡 First, you need a brilliant idea. It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, just something you're passionate about. Remember, you're building this solo, so you'll need that passion to fuel your journey.
User: 🛠️ Once you have your idea, it's time to build without coding! I used @webflow to create my website and app without any coding knowledge. It's incredibly user-friendly, with a plethora of customizable templates to suit your business.
User: @webflow 🧠 Organize your thoughts and plan your content using @NotionHQ. As a solopreneur, I found this to be the perfect tool for managing my tasks, jotting down ideas, and creating content outlines. Plus, it's super easy to use!
User: @webflow @NotionHQ 🎯 Find your niche and target audience. You don't need a massive audience to succeed—just a group of dedicated, engaged followers who love your work. Focus on connecting with them and providing value.
User: @webflow @NotionHQ 🗣️ Share your work and gather feedback. Join communities like @IndieHackers, @ProductHunt, and relevant Facebook groups to find like-minded people who can give you insights and encouragement.
User: @webflow @NotionHQ @IndieHackers @ProductHunt 💼 Set up a business model that works for you. From subscriptions and memberships to one-time purchases, find a revenue stream that fits your goals and caters to your audience's needs.
User: @webflow @NotionHQ @IndieHackers @ProductHunt 📚 Educate yourself! Attend webinars, read articles, and listen to podcasts to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and strategies. You don't need a formal education to succeed, just a curious mind!
User: @webflow @NotionHQ @IndieHackers @ProductHunt 🔁 Iterate, improve and grow. Be open to change and adapt to your audience's needs. Remember, building a business is an ongoing process, and there's always room for improvement!

Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below 🧵 (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different 😍
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (⌘+T).
Saying that, ⌘+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ⌘+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (💚 to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)
<STRICT_LINK>
User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!

User: For those who miss physical whiteboards and post-its this is the solution to easily (and virtually) visualize projects and organize brainstorming, project management and workflow visualization. It's very friendly, intuitive and compatible with other tools.

figma,G2,"User: Another problem that Miro solves is the challenge of sharing complex ideas in a simple way. Miro's range of templates, diagrams, and sticky notes make it easy to share ideas visually, which can be especially helpful for projects that require a lot of detail or complexity. This has allowed me to communicate my ideas more effectively with my team members, resulting in better collaboration and a more efficient workflow.
User: I have found Miro to be an incredibly powerful tool for collaborating with teams. One of the things I like best about Miro is how easy it is to use. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it simple to get started even for those who are not particularly tech-savvy. 
The real-time collaboration features in Miro are also incredibly helpful. Multiple team members can work on a board simultaneously, which helps to streamline the collaborative process and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features, such as templates, sticky notes, and diagrams, are highly customizable, allowing for greater flexibility when working on projects.
User: One thing that I have found to be a drawback of Miro is its pricing structure. While the platform offers a free plan, its more advanced features are only available with paid plans, which may be expensive for smaller teams or individuals. Additionally, the platform's extensive range of features can be overwhelming for new users, and it may take some time to learn how to use everything effectively. However, Miro's support resources, including video tutorials and a user community, are quite helpful in getting up to speed quickly.",The user loves FigJam for its ease of use and prefers it over multiple apps for conceptualizing ideas and storyboards.

figma,G2,"User: Miro solves two huge problems for me. 
 
1. Remote working and having collaborative sessions with other team members. Before I found Miro, having these sessions was incredibly hard 
2. When you write on a whiteboard, at some stage it gets rubbed off. Miro you can have endless whiteboards that you never need to delete
User: Miro is incredibly helpful for a number of reasons. The best way to look at it is like a whiteboard with all the relevant tools, online. You can use it for brainstorming sessions, mapping customer journeys, comparing notes and heaps more. It feels like I have only just scraped the surface with what is possible on Miro.
User: Honestly, there aren't many downsides to using Miro. The hardest part is probably getting use to it and understanding what you should use for certain things. Maybe some more tutorials would be helpful.","The user finds Figma helpful for design creation, review, and QA purposes, appreciating its easy-to-understand UI and simple commenting system.

Notion,Twitter,"User: **Arc browser continuous review**
Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below 🧵 (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different 😍
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (⌘+T).
Saying that, ⌘+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ⌘+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (💚 to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!
User: 13. The iOS app dropped
Unexpected but pleasant! Can't wait to dive in :-)
<STRICT_LINK>
User: Hey @browsercompany I need your help!
Is there a way to tell apps to open links in a specific space?

figma,Twitter,"User: We want to start using versioning in our projects and we are trying to figure out the best way to do it.
The approach that makes more sense to us is to create a new branch on each file for the new version.
Our issue is that we have team members working on each version (1 and 2) but we can’t create a new feature branch for the version 2 branch (we don’t have this issue for version 1 because that is the main branch).
Our question is if does exist an official way to work with different versions in the same file in order to handle versioning or if there is a better way to do this.
Example of what we need
Button v1 branch (main)
a new feature for Button v1 (a new branch from the main branch)
Button v2 branch (version 2 branch)
a new feature for Button v2 (a new branch from version 2 branch)
The second question is how to handle major, minor, and patch updates into Figma (following semantic versioning definition)

figma,Twitter,"User: Its really a heartbreaker that exporting the slices to pdf is not available in Figma. Sketch has it and it was working really great for us.
Some of our multinational stakeholders, whom we cannot insist to install or start an account for Figma or anything else, as they rely on pdf documents for design review or sharing with internal team. Sketch helped to convert the slices to pdf which was very light weight and compressible. When we moved to figma, the internal team as well few clients worked well with figma collaboration (same we did with Sketch too) and but the later ones didn’t. And now we are forced to go back to Sketch, as we understand that its the app that we could rely to accomplish all our requirements.

Notion is everything you wanted in a planner, and truly helped bring the planning side of me back to reality.

Tl;dr: I'm loving it! So far, it's been a fantastic experience. Arc brings a lot of fresh air to a place where innovation seemingly stopped.
What is Arc? Check out @browsercompany <STRICT_LINK>
Dive into the thread below 🧵 (1/n)
User: 1. First-time use experience
Really well done. I enjoyed the semi-interactive intro/learning experience. The keyboard shortcuts were introduced, too.
Setting up the colour scheme was excellent. Straight away, you know these guys are trying to do something different 😍
User: 2. First-time use (contd.)
I wish there was a bit more 'practice your shortcuts'; the only one that stuck with me was the one I already use elsewhere (⌘+T).
Saying that, ⌘+T execution is excellent and can be used for commands, very much like ⌘+K in other apps.
User: 3. Split view
This is my #1 feature so far.
It seems to me that the people at @browsercompany invested in getting to know users.
One would doubt there could be anything left to learn about using a browser in 2023. What 'customer problems' are there left to solve?
And still!
User: 4. Split view (contd.)
Split view solves a problem many of us have when we attempt to multitask. Our current workarounds include constantly rearranging windows (💚 to you BetterSnapTool) etc. It's chaos!
Time will tell if Split view solves this, but right now, I'm thrilled!
User: 5. Split view (contd.)
The microinteractions here feel just right. Intuitive, discoverable. The onboarding helped, too.
User: 6. Profiles
This is a big one for me. I struggled with this on Chrome. My solution was to strictly use Chrome for work stuff plus Safari for personal use.
But obviously, that doesn't work well.
User: 7. Ecosystem
My incumbent browsers allow me to browse across devices with one app ecosystem. I can easily continue on my iPadPro Safari, where I left off on my laptop and then seamlessly move to my phone.
Arc needs a mobile/tablet app.
User: 8. Mini Arc
I took the plunge and made Arc my default browser, and suddenly links from Slack opened in Mini Arc.
Great when I need to quickly check stuff and close the tab. But if I need to stay longer in the context, I still need to move from the Mini Arc to the full Arc.
User: 9. Sidebar
Shifting the tabs from the top bar to a sidebar was smart. This suits me for a few reasons
a) wide angle screen form factor
b) utility of vertical space is better for Spaces, history etc., all co-existing in one area
User: 10. Sidebar
However, my eyes were trained to look for tabs on top of the screen for so long that having them on LHS feels weird. This might change after a few more days.
I'd love the ability to move the sidebar between LHS and RHS, depending on when I place Arc on my monitor.
User: 11. Ecosystem (contd.)
I expected browsing on Arc won't be seamless across devices w.out native iOS apps. Turns out the iPadOS/MacOS continuity pushes the current tab across devices on the same iCloud account.
Not sure about the predictability of this, but so far looks good!
User: 12. Living with Arc
- can't imagine giving up Spaces
- pinned folders/bookmarks as expected
- keep forgetting to use Favourites
- have a love/hate relationship w. links opening in overlay
@browsercompany I *really* want to change icons on pinned folders, pretty please!

figma,Twitter,"User: Hi there, I am currently laying the foundations for a Design Language System. At the same time another team is working on the first of a series of Apps. My intention is to take the components that they create for that first app and then add them to the design system, so we can re-use elements for all the future Apps
The DLS and the the first App will be created as two separate design files within the same project. My hope was that at various intervals I would be able to copy and paste content from the App into the DLS then publish the library from the DLS and get the other team to use the library swap feature to swap their local components with those from the DLS published library.
But my initial tests lead me to believe that this isn’t possible. It seems that you can only use library swap on two externally published libraries rather than an external library (the DLS) and a local library (the App). Is this the case?
If so, what is the suggested workflow in this situation?
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks

figma,Twitter,"User: So I’m trying to embed video files with alpha channels for a presentation. I ran a test where I included a webm file over some live text. I previewed it as a presentation and it worked perfectly. I sent it to my manager to reveiw and when he looked at it the alpha channel was replaced w/ a black background and a white box around that content that’d previously been over transparency.
Is Figma re-encoding my file? If so it’s doing it wrong. If not, why is the video changing after a period of time?
User: I was told by a Figma rep that they don’t plan on fixing this because safari doesn’t support webm v9 w/ transparency. This seems silly because that’s only on mobile. Also the issue is with figma’s re-compression of uploaded webm. it works fine initially but breaks after they come in and incorrectly re-compress properly encoded files. I’d prefer my files Not work on safari mobile rather than have them look wrong everywhere.","User faced an issue with a dropdown menu in Figma, where it rapidly opened and closed during preview.

figma,G2,"User: Documenting information in diagrams/maps helps the team visualize complex information architecture and align on foundations. 
Sketching ideas in low fidelity increases our time to value at early design stages by allowing us to validate concepts before investing in high-fidelity visualizations.

Using FigJam to share information with less design-savvy coworkers offers a friendly way to collect and organize inspiration or audits.
User: FigJam makes it easy for me to sketch ideas, map information in diagrams, and collaborate with others.

It'd also be really helpful, for the facilitation of workshop activities, to be able to show and hide sections. this would ideally be on a user or for users or user groups.
